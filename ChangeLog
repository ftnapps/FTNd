v0.95.1		07-Jan-2008

	script:
		Added support for Zenwalk.


v0.95.0		25-Nov-2007 - 07-Jan-2008

	mbcico:
		The maximum speed to show to the other end is now 4294976295.

	mbsetup:
		Changed the maximum linespeed to display for TCP/IP sessions to
		4294976295. Numbers above 2147483647 might display on remote
		systems as negative numbers.



v0.92.0		08-Oct-2006 - 16-Oct-2007

	general:
                With this version de default internal character encoding is
                UTF-8. BBS users who have a UTF-8 terminal can use the bbs in
                UTF-8 mode and should have no troubles at all reading and
                writing messages in several language encodings.
		Fixed building on FreeBSD, tested on 5.3 and 6.2.
		Added support to link to the GeoIP library. If it's present on
		your system, mbcico, mbsebbs, mbnewusr and mbnntp will log the
		country from which the connection is made.
                Added example telnet login for NetBSD.
                Dropped support for NetBSD < 3.0.
                Added support for Ubuntu.
		Added support for the ARM processor.

	upgrade:
                Because some directories will be moved, a special upgrade
                procedure is needed. Take the following steps:
                1. Don't install the new source yet and make a backup!
                2. In the source topdir run "make clean".
                3. Unpack the new source.
                4. Build new source, "./configure" and "make".
                5. Run "./mbsetup-0.92.0/mbsetup", enter global setup and
                   leave with save. this 'should' move all your existing
                   language files to the new directory structure.
                6. "su", run "make install" and restart the bbs.
                7. "exit".
                If you didn't do steps 1 and 2 (automatic updates) and you
                installed the source over the old source, you will have some
                extra files in the lang subdir of the source. No big deal.
                If you didn't run step 5 then the new language paths have
                the default files from source and not your own. Your own files
                are then still under ~/english/*.* ~/dutch/*.* etc. Move the
                contents of these subdirs into ~/share/int/menus/en/* etc.
                Compile and install this new version.
                In all macro files html.* change the charset to UTF-8. You will
		find these in /opt/mbse/share/int/macro/*/html.*
                If you still have all default macro files then in the source
                directory mbsebbs/examples simply run "make macros" to install
                the updated versions.
                Run "mbfile index -f " once to regenerate all download html
                index pages with UTF-8 encoding. Check the error.log for
                errors.
                In mbsetup menu 1.3.7 change logo.asc into logo.ans and make
                sure you have that file. A note about the logo file, it will
                be displayed before we know if a user has a utf-8 or ansi
                terminal, so change your logo screen so that it has no ansi
                grafic characters, just plain ascii with ansi color codes.
                Start and leave mbsetup, this will upgrade the newfiles and
                filefind reports to set a defaults CHRS kludge CP437 2 which
                is good for reports with ANSI blockgraphics.
 		The next step is optional but advised to make the symbolic
		links in the download areas without path information:               

                mbse$ cd /opt/mbse/ftp
                mbse$ find pub -type l -exec rm '{}' \;
                mbse$ mbfile check

                Make sure mbtask is restarted.

                standard table we will fall back to the charset in the
                Content-type: header and try to initialize iconv with that
                value.
                For debug info help to me, the headers Content-Type and
                Content-Transfer-Encoding are temporary stored in the fido
                message as kludges.

		needed and upgrades the nodes settings.
                Add extra switches to unarchiver commands entry 11, see
                mbsetup for the archivers.
                In menus 7.n.3.14 check if the NR flag is off, unless you need
                it (which I doubt).

        mbsebbs:
                Removed antique line editor.
                Added check for users homedirectory permissions and attempt to

                There are no paths anymore in OLR download packet files.
                Made OLR bluewave packets CPU independant.
                Fixed a strange bug that ftell didn't work right, this caused
                corrupt bluewave download packets.
                Bluewave is now big/little endian correct.
                Added width marker for chat input and fixed linelength.

                Changed zmodem transmitter timeout to 60 seconds and changed
                the zmodem init fase so that clients that don't start automatic
                have a chance to start the transfer.
                The zmodem transmitter now uses buffered output.
                Added Change archiver menu.
                Added crontrol-U0 to display current archiver.
                Changes to OLR ASCII download:

                - Added a .info file with control information.

                and fail to start if they are missing.
                Don't start connections with IBC servers that miss settings in
                the chatserver setup.
                Several commands now send the server address from the servers
                setup to the neighbours.
                After server connect send the correct usernames already in chat.
                When the IBC server detects a IP change of a remote server it
                will completly restart the connection with that remote.
                Made several functions multithread aware.
                On shutdown also send PART and QUIT messages to all our links
                for our own users if they are still online so that the network
                will keep the correct state.
                Removed all thread programming so that mbtask is now a single
                process again.
