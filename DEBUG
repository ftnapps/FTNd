			Debugging with MBSE BBS.

From version 0.33.15 I changed the way debug logging goes. There are no more
#ifdef .. #endif directives in the code that change the loging behaviour.
Lines that could be logged in the code for debug are now written in two
possible ways:

Syslog('b', "This is always logged for debug");
Syslog('B', "This is logged if most_debug flag is true");

The difference is the uppercase or lowercase logclass. Uppercase is only logged
if the global flag most_debug is set to true. If you want to use it in one of
the sources declare that flag like this:

extern int most_debug;

Then, from the moment you need the extra debugging, insert

most_debug = TRUE;

in the code, and set it to FALSE when you are done. 

I did this because the extra debug is good for developers but not for regualar
users that need some extra logging. The log output with the most_debug flag
set to TRUE can be huge and does affect system performance.

For those who are developing code for MBSE BBS, use two kinds on debug logging.
