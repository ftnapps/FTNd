            LANGUAGE SOURCES FOR FTNd
            =========================


This directory contains the language sources for FTNd. The file
Language.xref is only a reference file with linenumbers and source
references. The files source.en, source.nl and source.de are the 
real language sources. The resulting files language.nl, language.en
and language.de are placed in the ~/share/int directory where the bbs 
will expect them to be.

If you make your own language files, use Language.xref as a guide.
The syntax for each language line is:

KEYS|Language line

The keys are the keys that the users must press for the right response.
Order is important. The "|" character is a seperator, the rest of the
language line is the line shown to the user. Trailing spaces are important!

If you do create language sources then I would like that you make them
public available and send them to me so I can include them in the
source distribution.

germandu    Malte Tychsen <2:240/9350@fidonet> (alternative german).
fr          Francois Thunus <2:270/24@fidonet>

If you want to use the germandu language instead of the default german
language then run "mblang germandu.txt language.de" and install the
file laguage.de in /opt/mbse/share/int.
