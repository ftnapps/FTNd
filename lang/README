			LANGUAGE SOURCES FOR MBSE BBS.
			==============================


This directory contains the language sources for MBSE BBS. The file
Language.xref is only a reference file with linenumbers and source
references. The files source.en, source.nl and source.de are the 
real language sources. The resulting files language.nl, language.en
and language.de are placed in the ~/share/int directory where the bbs 
will expect them to be.

If you make your own language files, use Language.xref as a guide.
The syntax for each language line is:

KEYS|Language line

The keys are the keys that the users must press for the right response.
Order is important. The "|" character is a seperator, the rest of the
language line is the line shown to the user. Trailing spaces are important!

If you do create language sources then I would like that you make them
public available and send them to me so I can include them in the
source distribution.

If you want to use the germandu language instead of the default german
language then run "mblang germandu.txt language.de" and install the
file laguage.de in /opt/mbse/share/int.
