This is the README file for mbcico, the fidonet mailer for MBSE BBS.

This is based on ifcico from the ifmail package written by Eugene G. Crosser
(crosser@pccross.msk.su), 2:5020/230@fidonet. He deserves most of the credits
for this product.

Many others have contributed to the original ifcico and utilities. This
version doesn't use the original config file anymore, it uses the databases
that are maintained with mbsetup. Also, mail behaviour is different then
in ifcico.

I wrote this special version to let it fully integrate with all the other
programs that are distributed with MBSE BBS, so that mbcico will function
in a multiline environment with mixed analogue modems, ISDN lines and internet.

The reason why I changed the name of this program is only to show that there
is a real difference in the behavior and configuration compared with ifcico.

The following people donated code to the original ifcico, this list is 
not complete. It is possible that I forgot someone, but these are the names
that I found in the several ifmail packages.
