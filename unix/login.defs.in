# Three items must be defined:  MAIL_DIR, ENV_SUPATH, and ENV_PATH.
# If unspecified, some arbitrary (and possibly incorrect) value will

#
# Comment lines (lines beginning with "#") and blank lines are ignored.

# and install ssh if you want to login using a shell.
#
ALLOW_FTND		no

#
# Ask a user when his username is not found if he wants to register as new
# user. If not, the user has to use the special account to start mbnewusr.
# If no, it is not bbs user friendly,
# If yes, usernames may be easy guessed, but most bbses do it like this.
#
ASK_NEWUSER		yes

#
# The newuser account name, defaults to "bbs". If you change this change it
# in the password files, change it in mbsetup and in this file. Better
# leave this unchanged.
#
NEWUSER_ACCOUNT		bbs

#
# Delay in seconds before being allowed another attempt after a login failure
#
FAIL_DELAY		3

#
ISSUE_FILE	@prefix@/etc/issue

# If defined, name of file whose presence which will inhibit non-root
# logins.  The contents of this file should be a message indicating
# why logins are inhibited.

#
# Terminal permissions
#
#	TTYGROUP	Login tty will be assigned this group ownership.
#	TTYPERM		Login tty will be set to this permission.
#
# If you have a "write" program which is "setgid" to a special group
# which owns the terminals, define TTYGROUP to the group number and
# TTYPERM to 0620.  Otherwise leave TTYGROUP commented out and assign
# TTYPERM to either 622 or 600.
#
TTYGROUP	tty
TTYPERM		0620

#
# Login configuration initializations:
#
#	ERASECHAR	Terminal ERASE character ('\010' = backspace).
#	KILLCHAR	Terminal KILL character ('\025' = CTRL/U).
#	UMASK		Default "umask" value.
#	ULIMIT		Default "ulimit" value.
#
# The ERASECHAR and KILLCHAR are used only on System V machines.
# The ULIMIT is used only if the system supports it.
# (now it works with setrlimit too; ulimit is in 512-byte units)
#
# Prefix these values with "0" to get octal, "0x" to get hexadecimal.
#
ERASECHAR	0177
KILLCHAR	025
UMASK		007

# algorithm compatible with the one used by recent releases of FreeBSD.
# It supports passwords of unlimited length and longer salt strings.
# Set to "no" if you need to copy encrypted passwords to other systems
# which don't understand the new algorithm.  Default is "no".
#
MD5_CRYPT_ENAB	yes

#
# Should login be allowed if we can't cd to the home directory?
# Default in no.
