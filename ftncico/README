This is the README file for ftncico, the fidonet mailer for FTNd.

This is based on ifcico from the ifmail package written by Eugene G. Crosser
(crosser@pccross.msk.su), 2:5020/230@fidonet. He deserves most of the credits
for this product.

Many others have contributed to the original ifcico and utilities. This
version doesn't use the original config file anymore, it uses the databases
that are maintained with mbsetup. Also, mail behaviour is different then
in ifcico.

Michiel Broek wrote the original special version mbcico, let it fully integrate
with all the other programs that were distributed with MBSE BBS from which ftncico
is derived, so that ftncico will function in a multiline environment with mixed
analogue modems, ISDN lines and internet.

The reason why he changed the name of this program is only to show that there
is a real difference in the behavior and configuration compared with ifcico.

The following people donated code to the original ifcico, this list is 
not complete. It is possible that I forgot someone, but these are the names
that I found in the several ifmail packages.
