v0.90.0		06-Nov-2005 - 23-Jul-2006

        upgrade:
                Start mbsetup once and leave, this will update user records
                with the wrong editor choice, fixes the files databases if
		needed and upgrades the nodes settings.
                Add extra switches to unarchiver commands entry 11, see
                mbsetup for the archivers.
                In menus 7.n.3.14 check if the NR flag is off, unless you need
                it (which I doubt).

        mbsebbs:
                Removed antique line editor.
                Added check for users homedirectory permissions and attempt to

                Fixed virus scan of uploaded archives.
                There are no paths anymore in OLR download packet files.
                Made OLR bluewave packets CPU independant.
                Fixed a strange bug that ftell didn't work right, this caused
                corrupt bluewave download packets.
                Bluewave is now big/little endian correct.
                Added width marker for chat input and fixed linelength.
                Added screen rows detection using ANSI sequences needed for
                some terminal programs like minicom.
                Writes LINES and COLUMNS environment into data.msg so that the
                joe editor can use that.
                Changed zmodem transmitter timeout to 60 seconds and changed
                the zmodem init fase so that clients that don't start automatic
                have a chance to start the transfer.
                The zmodem transmitter now uses buffered output.
                Added Change archiver menu.
                Added crontrol-U0 to display current archiver.
                Changes to OLR ASCII download:
                - area files are named after area tag if possible, dots are
                  replaced by underscores and extension is .text.
                - If available each message now has a msgid in the header.
                - Added a .info file with control information.
                Fixed logging of wrong file after upload.

                Added setup checks for two main configuration settings for IBC
                and fail to start if they are missing.

                Several commands now send the server address from the servers
                setup to the neighbours.
