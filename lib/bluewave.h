**                  *.MIX       Quick index to *.FTI records
**                  *.FTI       Information for all packet messages
**                  *.DAT       Packet message text
**
**      Reader:     *.NET       NetMail reply message information

**                  *.UPL       Reply message information
**                                (alternative to *.NET and *.UPI)
**                  *.REQ       List of files to download from BBS
**                  *.PDQ       Offline door configuration information
**                                (packet version 2 and earlier)
**                  *.OLC       Offline door configuration information
**                                (packet version 3 and later)
**
**      Misc:       *.MSG       Fido-style message header
**                                  (used *only* in the *.NET structure)
**                  *.XTI       Extended message packet information
**                                  (not an official part of the Blue Wave
**                                  packet specification; is used by the Blue
**                                  Wave reader only)
**
**  The door files (plus individual files for BBS bulletins) comprise a Blue
**  Wave message packet, and the reader files (plus individual files for each
**  message) comprise a Blue Wave reply packet.
**
**  In order to cover ALL BASES, and to be able to say that you were warned,
**  *ALL* unused fields should be set to ASCII NUL (0).  Any future
**  implementation of reserved fields will rely on the premise that the field
**  will be 0 if not implemented!  The same warning follows for BITMAPPED
**  fields.  If a bit is not implemented or is not used, TURN IT OFF (0).
**  (Clearing an entire structure can be easily accomplished via the memset()
**  function.  Example: "memset(&ftirec, 0, sizeof(FTI_REC))".)

/*
**  The data type definitions below help make these structures a little more
**  universal between environments.  The 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit data types
**  defined below can be used as-is with virtually all MS-DOS and OS/2 C/C++
**  compilers, but can be changed if necessary should your compiler define
**  data types in a different fashion.  (Note that the tCHAR and tINT types
**  are currently not used; they are included simply for completeness.)
**
**  IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT COMPILERS AND STRUCTURES:
**  All structures *must* be "packed" (i.e., the compiler MUST NOT insert
**  padding bytes between structure elements in order to force elements onto
**  word boundaries).  The Blue Wave products expect them to be packed; if
**  they aren't, you're bound to get some *very* interesting results.

**  Notes about the INF_HEADER.XXXXX_LEN fields, above:
**
**  Door authors should take the few extra lines of code to fill in the
**  structure lengths defined above.  Doing so will make the Blue Wave data
**  structures extensible and adaptable to almost any kind of file change that
**  may be required in the future.  The readers that use this mail packet
**  format should contain code to handle a structure length that is longer or
**  shorter than they expect.
**
**  Reader authors need to take the time to code for possible extensions to
**  this file format.  If the data fields are LONGER than expected, simply do
**  a seek to move to the next record, and ignore the extra information.  If
**  the data fields are SHORTER than expected, a simple "Please upgrade your
**  reader" should suffice. <grin>  However, you should never encounter a
**  record size smaller than the ones defined here.  Any extra information
**  that is sent in the packets probably would not be crucial, and you may be
**  able to continue with reading the packet anyway.
**
**  It should be noted that all current Blue Wave doors set these fields to 0,
**  as this extensibility was not added until recently.  If the structure
**  sizes are 0, the reader will assume that all records are of the sizes
**  defined here.  (Blue Wave readers below version 2.10 do NOT allow for
**  extensible data files.  Version 2.10, and all subsequent versions, WILL
**  handle them properly.)  DO NOT EXTEND THESE STRUCTURE FORMATS WITHOUT
**  NOTIFYING CUTTING EDGE COMPUTING FIRST!  If the extended information will
**  benefit programs/users, it will be officially added to the packet format.
**
**  The original values for the INF_HEADER.XXXXX_LEN structures are as below,
**  defined as macros which you can use in your programs.  Remember, if the
**  value in INF_HEADER.XXXXX_LEN is 0, you must use these values instead!

/*
**  Name of file:   *.MSG
**
**  Description:    The Fido *.MSG message (named for the BBS program on which
**                  it originated) has become a de-facto standard among BBS
**                  implementations, due to the sheer number of utilities
**                  available that operate with *.MSG messages.  It is as
**                  close to a universal message format as one can get in
**                  FidoNet (and FidoNet-style networks), and is the reason
**                  why it is used here (well, the *.MSG header, anyway).
**
**                  NOTE:   Most of the fields in the FTI_REC structure (shown
**                          above) correspond to similar fields in MSG_REC.
**                          This was done deliberately, in order to make
**                          *.FTI file processing a little more intuitive for
**                          programmers.  Also note that MSG_REC is only used
**                          by the NET_REC structure, which will soon become
**                          obsolete (replaced by UPL_REC).

**                  to record #1 in the *.FTI file, and so on).
**
**                  NOTE:   This file is currently created ONLY by the Blue

**                          documented here for third party programmers to use

**  Name of file:   *.REQ
**
**  Description:    The *.REQ file is simply a list of filenames the user
**                  wants to request from the host BBS.  Wildcard characters
**                  ("*" and "?" under MS-DOS) are allowed, but are not
**                  guaranteed to produce accurate results on all door
**                  implementations.
**
**                  NOTE:   Current Blue Wave doors do not accept wildcard
**                          characters in filenames, and will consider any
**                          filenames which contain them as being invalid.
**                          Additionally, if there are more than 10 entries in
**                          the *.REQ file, current Blue Wave doors will read
**                          the first 10 and discard the rest.  These are
**                          limitations of the Blue Wave doors, not of the
**                          Blue Wave format itself.
**
**  File format:    REQ_REC     { repeated for as many files as }
**                  REQ_REC     { requested from the host BBS   }
**                  ...

/*
**  Name of file:   *.PDQ
**
**  Description:    The *.PDQ file contains the information used for the
**                  offline configuration feature of the mail door.  After the
**                  header is a series of records which indicate the message
**                  areas to enable for scanning the next time a mail packet
**                  is requested.
**
**                  NOTE:   Readers should generate a *.PDQ file *ONLY* if
**                          the mail packet format is version 2 or earlier;
**                          otherwise, a *.OLC file should be generated.
**                          Doors should process *.PDQ files *ONLY* in cases
**                          where a *.OLC file is not present.
**
**                          If the AREA_CHANGES flag in PDQ_HEADER.FLAGS is
**                          set, the door should process the offline
**                          configuration as well as changes to the list of
**                          areas the user wants to download.  In the Blue
**                          Wave door, this is done by first turning OFF all
**                          message areas that were active, then turning ON
**                          the ones specified in the *.PDQ file.  This seems
**                          to be the simplest, most straight-forward method
**                          of accomplishing this task, though other, more
**                          complex schemes could easily have been devised.
**
**  File format:    PDQ_HEADER      { only included one time!
**                  PDQ_REC         { repeated for as many message areas }
**                  PDQ_REC         { as the user wishes to enable       }
**                  ...
