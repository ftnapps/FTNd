            FTNd TODO list
            ==============

    These are a list of things that must be implemented one way or
    another. Some things are urgent and necessary to operate the bbs
    without human intervention, others are just for comfort, or nice.
    I think this list will always contain items, I only hope the urgent
    matters will be removed. Note that much of these were brought over
    from the MBSE BBS TODO, from which FTNd is derived.

    Classes:
         U = Urgent.
         N = Normal, second priority.
         L = Cosmetic or nice to have.
         W = Feature request.
         X = Will not be done unless it's really needed.



everything:
    N: At least for on Ubuntu, the scripts/installinit.sh identifies OS as Debian.
      I.E., it's only checking for '/etc/debian_version' which can also be present
      on Ubuntu and perhaps other Debian derivitives and may not reflect the proper
      OS version.

    N: Code repository includes being hosted at GitHub, which has Travis CI 
       funtionality avaiable for free.  Investigate adding that for FTNd?

    N: Change build system from Autotools to CMake.

    N: One of the issues with the legacy code is that it is not FHS compliant
       and one big related issue is that the paths for the configuration data
       files are hard coded to be (currently)"$FTND_ROOT/etc/*.data".

    W: Long term solution for the issue with the hardcoded paths would be to
       create a function that provides the path for, for instance, the
       configuration data files instead of how it's currently being done.

    W: Once the code has been updated to be FHS compliant, the example/* files
       will need to be updated to reflect the changes as necessary.

    N: Are the JAM related files listed correctly for the copyright information?

    N: In BSO the i flavor should have been d flavor.

    W: Increase size of Unix usernames > 8. The limit on Slackware is 32
       characters, defined in utmp.h in UT_NAMESIZE

    W: Add personal message area.

    N: The ttyinfo.tty field is too short for NetBSD.

    W: Implement topic groups for file and message areas, with access level
       control.

    W: Switch to a database backend for storing the configuration etc, instead
       of using the *.data files. This can also solve some other limitations.

    W: An API could be added.

    N: There are still entries that reference "MB" something instead of "FTN"
       something, like for logging code entries.

    L: Multiple files have whitespace issues; at least where tabs, which are not
       consistantly set on systems, are used instead of spaces.

    L: There's a lot of noise from this but it also finds alot of things that
       still need to be fixed:  $ grep -r mb *


HTML docs:
   N: Do not really need both a html/index.htm.in file and a html/index.html.in
      file. If still need somehthing like an html/index.html file, use a sym
      link.

   N: There does not appear to be an html doc for the 'ftnnewusr' program.

   N: "Last Update" date in the html manual is still showing 01-Mar-2007; that 
      needs to be updated to current date whenever the doc gets changed. There
      appears to be what might be the overall date on index.html page plus dates

   N: There still appears to be references to "MBSE BBS" or "mbse bbs" that need
      to be changed to FTNd.

   N: There also appears to be refernces to the old program names that are still
      in the docs.  Like "mbfido areas" in doc/ftnd/html/setup/emgroup.html.


ftnaff:
    W: Rewrite filefind search algorithm.


ftnbbs:
    W: OLR, implement file requests.

    N: Only count posted messages in local mail areas.

    X: OLR: include private email area in download packets. See also global
           wish for private mail areas.

    X: OLR: implement some global settings from the offline configuration.

    N: OLR: qwk, check netmail entered from reader, fido address missing?

    X: Implement kermit protocol? External versions don't work right.


ftncico:
    W: Implement binkp option ND and NDA.


ftnfido:
    N: Don't log an error if no file_id.diz is found.

    W: Check all .flo files for dead attachments.

    W: Check all .flo files for to old attachments.

    W: Count posted messages during mailscan.

    W: Code cleanup and make a structure in this program. Remove duplicate
       or similar functions.

    N: Process GoldED filerequest netmails with the filereq flag set, we
       should create a .req file with the contents of the subject line.

    N: Process To: and Cc: lines in messages gated from Fido to Internet.

    N: Investigate a method to scan and filter messages using the gateway.

    W: Add macro's for stats of all months.

    X: Implement file requests for directory nodes.

    W: Add %from command to areamgr/filemgr.

    W: Add netmail notification of changed areas.

    W: Make it possible to only virus scan the complete archives.

    W: Let ftnfido areas with a special switch update area descriptions.

    W: Send rulefile via netmail for each new connected mail area.

    W: Send notifications to downlinks about changed areas from uplink.

    W: Add statistic mail messages. Via AMC??

    N: Hatch statistics are not updated.

    W: Copy personal mail to a personal message area.

    W: Someday make retoss from bad possible (volonteers?).

    W: AreaMgr %rescan should auto connect disconnected areas.


ftnnntp:
    N: fetched mail doesn't get the status Rcvd if it was for the user.

    N: Do a better job for message linking by newsclients. This is a
       problem because we use the message nuftners and messages are
       sometimes renumbered. This will make some clients try to fetch
       the wrong messages because they cache the message id's.

    N: Lastread pointers are not updated.

    N: Investigate a method to scan and filter messages using the gateway.


ftnnewusr:


ftnpasswd:
    N: unix/ftnpasswd.c:       fprintf(stderr, "ftnpasswd: You are not a member of group \"bbs\".\n");
       That should be "ftnbbs", not "bbs"?


ftnsetup:
    N: On the 'Edit Registration Info' in ftnsetup, option 9 Newuser defaults to
      'bbs' instead of 'ftnbbs'. 

    N: This should really point to /use/share/ftnd/doc, or to /var/lib/ftn/doc
       (This is from option 22 on the main setup page)
          Erasing directory /usr/lib/ftnd/share/doc/html
          Created site documents in /usr/lib/ftnd/share/doc
       The files being created are either text or html files so they fit in 
       /usr/share, but they also get update each time that menu item 22
       gets selected, which seems to fit /var/lib better.

    U: Menu 7.x.4.1 password length too large?

    U: Add check for empty data files.

    N: Add a check for double areatag names. See MySQL plan.

    N: Use some sort of sorting for the system aka's and make sure the
       main aka with zone's is listed first. Having zone's mixed gives
       too high outbound stats and the outbound is scanned multiple times.

    N: Put ZMH fields in the network setup for each zone. Currently Z1-6.
       See MySQL plan.

    W: Add global setup in menus 9.1 and 10.1 at least to change uplink
       data.

    W: See if a check can be made in file groups setup for the areas file
       format, if a filegate list is installed and the filegate switch
       setting is wrong, a lot of wrong areas will be created.
