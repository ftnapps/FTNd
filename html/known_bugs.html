There are always more bugs, but these are known....

<UL>
<LI>Reading of function keys in FTNd doesn't work always well, especially on
slow links and over PPP. This is not a FTNd problem.

<LI>Problems with D'Bridge [1a] mailers.

<LI>If you have regular sessions with a node wich only supports FTS-0001
sessions and you use a session password you <b>must</b> also set a mail password
and these passwords must be the same. This is a side effect of the way FTS-0001
handshake works, by sending a small mail packet wich contains the password.

<LI>Some Linux distributions have their glibc libraries compiled wrong, that
will cause the <b>mbtask</b> program to do nothing usefull. This problem seems
to have gone away.

<LI>You cannot share the JAM message bases between little-endian and big-endian
machines using networked filesystems because the storage format doesn't specify 
the internal byte order for different CPU's. This is an error in the JAM spec.
</UL>
