<H3>Distribution.</H3>
<P>
These are the only official distribution sites for the package. They are:
<OL>
 <LI><A HREF="https://ftn.rocasa.net" rel="nofollow">https://ftn.rocasa.net</A>
 <LI>Fidonet node 1:120/544 binkp ftn.rocasa.net (magic: FTNDSRC)
 <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ftnapps/FTNd" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ftnapps/FTNd</A>
</OL>
If you find on another site it may be out of date. I have no control over these
sites. New versions of are announced in the fidonet area LINUX_BBS or BBS_CARNIVAL
or various of the File Announce echos. On the official fidonet nodes you can
request the latest version of the source with the magic FTNDSRC. You will then
get a zip file, in this zip file is the original tar.gz file. This is to let
systems who only support 8.3 filenames to pickup the distribution package.

<H3>History.</H3>
<P>
The FTNd application was derived from MBSE BBS.

At the end of 1997 the original author of MBSE BBS was looking for several BBS
systems that could run on GNU/Linux and should be capable to runing Fidonet mail.
After reviewing almost all packages that were available at that time he found
that there were no packages that suited his needs. Some had the plain user
interfaces that his bbs users were used to but no Fidonet capabilities, others
looked awfull or were difficult to use by normal bbs users without Unix experience.
He also didn't want to run shareware anymore, one day you pay for some program,
and the next day support is over because the writer of that program decided
to stop development or simply disappears from the Fidonet stage. With all
Y2K problems ahead the solution should be Open Software so that you have
the sources in case something goes wrong.
One package was very interesting and had the look and feel of RemoteAcces,
that package was RapidBBS. There was only one problem, it had no Fidonet
capabilities. He rewrote the data structures and created a deamon that should
control all bbs acivities. In March 1998 he started writing the mbfido program
that should handle all Fidonet mail and .tic files. In June 1998 the final
message base format became JAM using the LoraBBS sources as a guide to create
the JAM libraries. The original JAMapi was not stable enough to do all the work
that needed to be done.
<P>
In July 1998 the first version of MBSE BBS was installed on the bbs he had,
on the second line. The first line was running McMail, GEcho and RA on a
Novell client while on the GNU/Linux box the mars_nwe emulator from Martin Stower
was running. In November 1998 mbcico was created from ifcico from Eugene M.
Crosser. In January 1999 it did also compile and run on a Sun Sparcstation 2
system.
<P>
In April 1999 the motherboard of the GNU/Linux server he was using died, he
replaced it with the MOBO of one of the client machines. From that day on,
MBSE BBS became the only bbs running on his system, because he was short on
serial port boards at that time. McMail and RA became history and MBSE BBS was
on its own. From that day on, updates were almost daily, all users and up and
downlinks showed that there were plenty of bugs to solve. One month later most
problems were solved.
<P>
In July 1999 Jan van de Werken started beta testing MBSE BBS on his system.
In September 1999 MBSE BBS was public released for the first time.
<P>
In 2012, Robert James Clay started working on an FTNd fork of MBSE BBS,
and has been testing it at the private fidonet node 1:120/419.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Is it Y2K ready?</H3>
<P>
There have been no problems since 1 January 2000 with MBSE BBS. He did run
pktdate by Tobias Ernst in the tosser, this solved problems with incoming
mail. Due to the internal date format, this program should run until 2038, 
just as long as Unix/Linux and the internet will function without changing 
the date format.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Future plans.</H3>
<P>
Plans are to completly integrate www and chat into FTDd. It
should work for browsers about the same as with ANSI character terminals.
