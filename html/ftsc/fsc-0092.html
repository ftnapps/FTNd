   Status of this document:

         This document proposes a standard for the Fidonet(tm) community
         and for other networks using Fido technology. It may be freely
         distributed if unchanged.

         You can reach the author at one of the addresses listed at the end
         of the document.


   Abstract:

         Most fidonet message editors offer a "forward" function. Using
         this function a user A can sort of "redirect" a message from user B
         to another user C, maybe because A is not the correct recipient or
         because C is a better person to answer the message. The name and
         address of B are usually included in the forward in free-text format.
         The message text is included in non-quoted format.

         A problem arises when the final recipient C wants to reply to sender B
         of the forwarded message. The forward contains the intermediate user A
         as the sender. So user C must insert the name and address of B
         manually, using the information contained in the message text. The
         message editor of C can't do this automatically because of the
         free-text format. The editor will also use incorrect quote initials,
         which is at least irritating.

         This document introduces 6 new control lines which contain the header
         information of the original message. With these control lines the
         message editor can use the original header information automatically.


   Specifications:

         There are 7 new control lines: FWDFROM, FWDTO, FWDORIG, FWDDEST,
         FWDSUBJ, FWDAREA, FWDMSGID. As all control lines they start with an
         ASCII 01 character followed by the control line name followed by
         whitespace followed by the control line's content followed by ASCII 13.

         Please note that all these control lines do not have a colon (like the
         control lines in FTS-0001). This would be just waste of space.

         FWDFROM
         -------

         This control line contains the name of the original sender as found in
         the FROM field of the original message. Leading and trailing
         whitespace should be removed. This control line should be omitted
         altogether if the FROM field is empty.

         FWDTO
         -----

         This control line contains the name of the original recipient as found
         in the TO field of the original message. Leading and trailing
         whitespace should be removed. This control line should be omitted
         altogether if the TO field is empty.

         FWDORIG
         -------

         This control line contains the address of the original sender as found
         in the ORIG field of the original message. The usual 5D ASCII notation
         (zone:net/node.point@domain) should be used. This control line should
         be omitted altogether if the address is not known.

         FWDDEST
         -------

         This control line contains the address of the original recipient as
         found in the DEST field of the original message. The usual 5D ASCII
         notation (zone:net/node.point@domain) should be used. This control line
         should be omitted altogether if the address is not known or unsure
         (as it is the case with forwarded echomail messages).

         FWDSUBJ
         -------

         This control line contains the subject line of the original message.
         This control line should be omitted altogether if the SUBJ field is
         empty.
         This control line should by made optional for security reasons. Echo
         manager passwords are too easily revealed with it.


         FWDAREA
         -------

         This control line contains the name of the echomail area where the
         original message was forwarded from. It should be omitted altogether
         if the original message was not forwarded from an echomail area.

         FWDMSGID
         --------

         This control line contains the MSGID control line of the original
         message. It should be omitted altogether if a MSGID control line is not
         present in the original message.


   Usage:

         When the "forward" function of the message editor is invoked, the
         editor program should generate the proposed control lines from the
         header of the original message. If the original message already was
         a forwarded one (indicated by the presence of at least a FWDORIG
         control line), the editor should keep all FWD* control lines and should
         not add any FWD* control lines. This preserves the FWD* control lines
         of the first forwarder, containing the header data of the author of
         the original message.

         The editor should not generate FWD* control lines, if the message isn't
         to be forwarded. A mail forwarding robot may also generate these
         control lines, if it not just readdresses the message.

         When the "reply" function of the editor is invoked the program should
         use the control lines' contents instead of the header information. The
         control lines should not be included in the reply.

         Since it may not be immediately clear whether the user wants to reply
         to the forwarder or to the original sender, the editor should offer a
         means to ignore the proposed control lines and start a "normal" reply
         instead, e.g. by two distinct functions, user preference or dialog.


         Pseudo code:

         forwarding_message:
            if is_forwarded_message then
               don't change FWD* control lines
            else
               add FWD* control lines

         quoting_message:
            if is_forwarded_message then
               if reply_to_forwarder then
                  use header data (normal quoting)
               else
                  use FWD* control lines
               remove FWD* control lines from reply
            else
               use header data (normal quoting)

         other_functions:
            remove/ignore FWD* control lines


   Example:

         Message from Joe User to my boss node:

            From: Joe User 1:234/567
            To:   Harry Herrmannsdoerfer 2:2490/2520
            Subj: Some questions
            @MSGID: 1:234/567 12345678
            Text: Hello Harry!
                  ...

         Harry forwards the message to me:

            From: Harry Herrmannsdoerfer 2:2490/2520
            To:   Michael Hohner 2:2490/2520.17
            Subj: Joe's message
            @FWDFROM Joe User
            @FWDORIG 1:234/567
            @FWDTO   Harry Herrmannsdoerfer
            @FWDDEST 2:2490/2520
            @FWDSUBJ Some questions
            @FWDMSGID 1:234/567 12345678
            Text: Hi Michael!
                  ...

         My answer using the new control lines:

            From: Michael Hohner 2:2490/2520.17
            To:   Joe User 1:234/567
            Subj: Some questions
            @REPLY: 1:234/567 12345678
            Text: Hi Joe!

                  JU&gt; ...
                  ...


   Compatiblity:

         Editor programs which are not prepared for the proposed control lines
         usually just ignore them and remove them from a reply. A reply goes
         to the forwarder. Nothing gained and nothing lost.


   Implementations:

         This proposal is implemented in the author's Fidonet editor
         "FleetStreet for OS/2" (versions 1.17 and above).
