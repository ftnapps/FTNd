Status of this document:

     This FSC suggests a proposed protocol for the FidoNet(r) community,
     and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
     Distribution of this document is unlimited.

     Fido and FidoNet are registered marks of Tom Jennings and Fido
     Software.


     Purpose

     To explain and document the existing usage of the ^aFLAGS field used
     by many software packages, including FrontDoor, TosScan, and
     D'Bridge. And to inform software authors of its proper usage.


     Prologue

     One of the problems with the FTS-1 (stored) message format is its
     limitations in regards to message attributes. Several bits are used
     (reserved) by SEAdog, another by several packers and editors - even
     though most mailer authors don't support them, they remain. One
     reason would be backward compatibility with older software.

     Unfortunately, this presents a problem for software authors that
     would like to pass extended message attributes for use and handling
     by other software.

     Some software packages have been using an alternate method called
     "FLAGS" which is 7-bit ASCII placed behind <SOH>FLAGS somewhere near
     the beginning of a message. The various flags will now be described.


     Flags

     The FLAGS string should be placed somewhere near the beginning of
     the message text, and is preceeded by a &lt;SOH&gt; (^a) character. There
     is no need to support all or any of the below mentioned flags.

     If flags are stripped when a message passes through a system, all
     relevant and correct FTS-1 status bits should be updated to indicate
     the original contents of the FLAGS field.


     Flag      Brief          Long description
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     PVT       Private        Indicates that the message may only be read

                              asked to generate a receipt to the author
                              of the message that indicates that the
                              message arrived at its final destination.

     CFM       Confirm REQ    When message is read by its addressee, a

                              the author of the message.

     HIR       HiRes          FAX: Hi-Resolution image.

|    FAX       Fax image      The filename specified in the message's
|                             subject field contains a fax document that
|                             should be viewed using software capable of
|                             doing so.

|    FPU       Force pickup   Treated as a message with an IMM flag. This

|                             destination system, if the connection is
|                             aborted for some reason, until a valid "End
|                             of files" signal is received (i.e. no more
|                             files remain to pick up).


     Notes

     Xmail is related to the ARCmail 0.60 standard as adopted by the FTSC.
     The exception is that any type of compression method may be used and
     the naming convention isn't necessarily limited to that of the
     ARCmail 0.60 standard.
