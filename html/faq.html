<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This FAQ is a work in progress. It is not complete, nor does its author
claim   that it is complete. This FAQ only answers questions pertaining to
using MBSE   BBS on your GNU/Linux box. It is a compilation of previous questions 
that Michiel   Broek has recieved and answered from us newbies in getting 
MBSE up &amp; running.

     When mbse was first developed the hardware was not fast enough to run 
     these programs at full speed. The mailer could give CRC errors and the 
     bbs seemed to stop now and then. To overcome this problem all programs 
     started with the -quiet switch (background jobs) are stopping for short 
     periods so that they would use less system resources. Systems with SCSI 
     disks or other fast and well designed machines don't have a need for that 
     slowdown. In mbsetup menu 1.5.17 is the setting for the speed of all utility 
     programs, the default is slow. You might try this set to fast and see what
     happens on your system.</td>

   <td>Follow the next steps to setup your system for FTP clients. 
    <ol>
     <li>As root, add a new group to your system: <b>groupadd bbsftp</b>.</li>
     <li>Make sure there is a directory /opt/mbse/var/bbsftp. This directory 
      	 should be owned by mbse, group bbs and have mode 0775.</li>
     <li>Add an invalid shell to /etc/shells, /usr/bin/false is good.</li>
     <li>Install an FTP server, the examples here are for ProFTPD.</li>
     <li>In /etc/proftpd.conf make sure there are the following lines: 
<pre>
# Anonymous ftp and members of group bbsftp have a chroot environment.
# DefaultRoot     ~ bbsftp
</pre>
         This will make sure that users who are member of the bbsftp
         group have a chrooted directory structure for their ftp directories.
 	 Also make sure the line Umask 022 is changed to Umask 002.</li>
     <li>Add a username for the node you whish to give an FTP feed.
         Use the following as root:                                            
<pre>
useradd -g bbs -G bbsftp -d /opt/mbse/var/bbsftp/username
    -s /usr/bin/false -c "FTP Account for username" -m username
</pre>
         Note: this is one line! There will now be a user added and
         have a  home  directory of /opt/mbse/var/bbsftp/username. Make sure
         that  directory has  permission 0775 or 0770. Create in the username
         directory two other directories, inbound and outbound. They must
         be owned by the user and be a member of group bbs and have mode 0775.
         The modes  077x are needed because the user and mbse must be able to
         read and write  to these directories.</li>
     <li>Try to login with ftp from some other system with the choosen 
      	 username and his password and check the changes until now. You should 
    	 not be able to escape from the directories of this user and you should 
   	 be able to upload files, download and delete files. Check also if you 
 	 uploaded a file if user mbse can delete that file and also put a file 
	 in the users ftp directory as user mbse, and check that you can download 
         and delete is as ftp user.</li>
     <li>Make sure for the node you want to change there is no mail
         left in the outbound. Now start mbsetup, menu 7, open the setup
         of the node that will use ftp. In screen 3, items 7 and 8, set these
         to  Directory. Now enter screen 8, here you will setup the directory
         session.                                                                
<pre>
       7.8  EDIT NODE DIRECTORY SESSION

            Outbound settings
       1.   Files path      /opt/mbse/var/bbsftp/username/outbound

       11.  Create lock     Yes
       12.  Create lockfile /opt/mbse/var/bbsftp/username/lock.bsy
</pre>
         Save this and you are ready.</li>
     <li>A final note, since this user is in group bbs and not in the
         bbs userdatabase he can never telnet to your system with this account
         and get a shell. The user doesn't even have a valid shell.</li>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td valign="Top">A 3.3</td>
   <td>There are several reasons why mbcico refuses to call an internet
       node, most problems are nodelist related. A internet node with binkp
       protocol should be listed with the flags CM,IBN before mbcico will
       make a call. Also, in the nodelist system name field there should
       be the hosts full qualified domainname so that mbcico can get that
       node's IP address. If one of these items are missing, the node will
       not be called. To correct this problem there are two options, make
       sure the node is listed with a dns name and proper flags in the nodelist.
       The second option is to add a setup record for that node and fill in
       the nodelist override fields. You can find these in menu 7.3, item
       5 can be filled with the nodelist flags, ie. CM,IBN and item 6 can   
       be used to give that node's fdn or IP address.                        
       <p>
       If the call still fails there are several things that must be
       right before mbcico makes any internet call. In mbmon, screen 2 (SERVER
       STATS) there are flags that indicate if the system is running, internet
       is available and the bbs is open. If one of these is No, then no call will
       be made. (For POTS the Internet flag does not matter of course).
       <p> 
       In mbsetup, screen 18 (taskmanager), you need to set the maximum 
       TCP sessions to allow. This is inbound and outbound together. So if you set
       this to 3 and 3 or more systems are already calling in via internet, your
       system will not call anymore until the amount of TCP sessions drops below 3.
       <p>
       If you set this to high on an average cable/adsl connection, 
       you can get into trouble because you use up all upstream bandwidth. (We have
       seen a lot of errors at a busy when the upstream speed was 64K and downspeed
       512K and about 4 sessions together). A good rule seems 1 TCP session for
       each 32K bandwidth.
       <p>
       Then turn in that same screen debug on. After a minute mbtask 
       rereads his configuration.
       <p>
       Make a poll with mbout poll &lt;node&gt;.
       <p>
       Watch the mbtask logfile and see what it does for that node. It
       should be added to the calllist. If not, it might be still a nodelist problem.</td>

       Easy using the script below, provided the file archives (*.zip, *.rar, *.arc, 
       *.lha, etc.) all contain "file_id.diz" files.
       <p>
       Sort the files in tempory directries that correspond to the filebase area, ie. 
       /dos4 (DOS files - filebase area no 4)
       <p>
       Then copy the script below to the directory, edit the number of the filebase 
       that the files must be batch uploaded to, to the number that corresponds to 
       the required filebase. (On my BBS system the DOS file section corresponds to 
       the number 4, hence the name above for the tempory directory used above) I 
       copy all files to be batch uploaded to the DOS file section, to the /dos4 
       directory, copy the script below to the /dos4 directory, edit the script so 
       that it uploads to the DOS filebase (4) and run it.
<pre>
for file in `ls` ; do
  mbfile adopt 4 $file "Dummy description"
done
</pre>
       NOTE: the 4 in the script above, indicates the filebase/filearea that the 
       files will be batch uploaded to.

       For archives that have/contain a file_id.diz file, "Dummy description" will be 
       replaced with the content of the "file_id.diz file of that archive, if no 
       file_id.diz exists in the archive, then "Dummy descrition" will appear in the 
       description field of the files.bbs file for the file area it gets uploaded to.
       <p>
       If the files don't have/contain file_id.diz files, then create and insert in 
       the archive, a file_id.diz file having a suitable description of the content 
       of the archive, then follow the instructions above.
       <p>
       For *.exe and *.com files, as well as other files that are not archived ie. in 
       *.zip/*.rar/*.arc/*.lha/*.lhz/*.zoo etc. Create a file_id.diz file for the 
       file, then make an archive using the archiver of your choice containing the 
       file and the file_id.diz you created for it, then follow the instructions 
       above.

       <p>
       <b>INTRODUCTION</b>
       <p> 
       This document describes how I have been able to execute MS/DOS 
       doors in  MBSEBBS. Probably it is not the best way to do it, but this 
       is the one that works for me. If somebody finds one more more effective, 
       or simpler or safer a solution, then I like to hear this solution.
       <p>
       <b>WHAT IS NEEDED?</b>
       <p> 
       MBSEBBS is correctly compiled and working, in my case I have the
       version  0.33.19, that is at the moment the most recent and stable, I suppose
       that this method can be valid for newer versions. DOSEMU 1.0.2 I have tried
       previous versions, but these do not work correctly with virtual ports. You
       can download dosemu.1.02.tgz from  <a href="www.dosemu.org">www.dosemu.org</a>
       , you may also need to download the freedos archive dosemu-freedos-bin-1.02.tgz.
       A partition with MS/DOS, I have on my disc a partition with installed
       MS/DOS, and that is the one that I use, but I'm sure that many doors
       could  work correctly with the freedos. You also need <b>sudo</b>. Sudo
       is a utility that let's ordinary users execute certain programs as superuser,
       this is available with almost all GNU/Linux distributions.
       <p>
       <b>COMPILING DOSEMU</b>
       <p> 
       Unpack dosemu in some directory, for example /usr/src, then changed 
       into that directory and execute 'make'. When this is ready we have 
       dosemu compiled. If we already had a previous version of dosemu it is 
       advisable to uninstall it before continuing. Copy dosemu-freedos-bin-1.02.tgz 
       to the toplevel directory of the dosemu source and execute:
<pre>
./install_systemwide -fd dosemu-freedos-bin-1.02.tgz
</pre>
       In the directory etc, within the directory where we have decompressed 
       the source code of dosemu we have configuration examples. Create the 
       directory /var/lib/dosemu if it does not exist the directory, and copy 
       global.conf to that directory. Also copy dosemu.conf to directory /etc 
       and copy dosemu.users.secure as dosemu.users to /etc.               
       <p>
       <b>CONFIGURE THE DOS PARTITION</b>
       <p> 
       Now we must configure the dos partition, in my case this exists 
       as a mounted dos partition in /dos/c. If this is not the case then you
       could work with an image of freedos. I have created in my dos partition 
       a directory c:\doors where I install all doors that I want to use, and 
       a file called c:\doors.bat with the following contents:
<pre>
@echo off
c:
cd \doors
if exist %1.bat call %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
c:\dosemu\exitemu
</pre>
       Change to the directory /var/lib/dosemu and create directory
       called for example 'c':                                          
<pre>
mkdir c. 
</pre>
       A link to the mounted partition could be made but I prefer
       to  create a new directory and in that directory make links to dos program 
       which are only of interest for us. Many programs and directories of the 
       dos partition are not needed in dosemu and to run doors. Change to the 
       created directory and make links to everything what we have in our dos 
       partition (we will erase  soon what we do not need).  Autoexec.bat and 
       config.sys must copied instead  of making links so we can modify them, because
       surely we will want that they  are different in dosemu, then in real dos.
<pre>
cd c
ln -s /dos/c/* .
rm autoexec.bat
rm config.sys
cp /dos/c/autoexec.bat config.sys .
</pre>
       Create a directory dosemu and copy the typical utilities of dosemu.
<pre>
mkdir dosemu 
cp /usr/src/dosemu-1.02/1.0.2.0/commands/* dosemu
</pre>
       Now we modify the copy of config.sys and autoexec.bat to erase
       everything what is not necessary to execute our games as doors, like
       drivers for cdrom, mouse etc... We will clear the keyboard driver 'KEYB
       XX' and make sure that in the path in autoexec.bat to include the directory
       c:\dosemu. Also load the fossil emulator, for example add these two lines:
<pre>
path %PATH%:c:\dosemu
c:\dosemu\fossil
</pre>
       If there is another fossil, such as bnu or x00 in config.sys
       or  autoexec.bat we clear all references to these, we will load them
       if that is necessary in the file that it executes the door when needed, 
       this can be necessary for some doors and for other not. Now we can erase 
       all the links to the directories who are not necessary, and that we do
       not want that they are visible.
       <p> 
       Then edit the file /etc/dosemu.conf and look for the line that 
       begins with "$_hdimage =" and change that to:
<pre>
$_hdimage = "c"
</pre>
       Now login as root and you should be able to execute our dos 
       emulator by executing '/usr/bin/dosemu.bin'                         
       <p> 
       (to leave dosemu type in exitemu)
       <p>
       <b>CONFIGURING SUDO</b>
       <p> 
       Normally the dos partition is not accessible to the users of the
       BBS, except from within dosemu, and to be able to have access without activating
       the setuid bit of dosemu, we use sudo so that any user of the BBS can execute
       dosemu.bin as root. As root execute visudo to edit the configuration file
       of sudo add the lines:
<pre>
%bbs   ALL=NOPASSWD:/opt/mbse/bin/bbsdoor.sh
%bbs   ALL=NOPASSWD:/opt/dosemu/bin/dosemu.bin
</pre>
       The first command is a script that takes care of copying the
       file door.sys to the dos partition, the second line is to allow to
       execute dosemu.bin. Any user of group BBS can execute these commandos

       <b>INSTALLING A DOOR</b>
       <p> 
       First we need a pair of scripts. These scripts are installed when
       you did install MBSE. These scripts are needed to execute the doors and are
       installed in /opt/mbse/bin:
<pre>
--- rundoor.sh ---

#!/bin/bash
#
# rundoor.sh - Never call this script directly, create a symlink
#              to thisfile with the name of the door. For example
#              tu run the door ilord do:
#              cd /opt/mbse/bin

if [ "$1" != "" ]; then
    if [ "$2" != "" ]; then
        mkdir -p /dos/c/doors/node$2 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
	# Copy door.sys to dos partition
	cat ~/door.sys &gt;/dos/c/doors/node$2/door.sys
	# Create .dosemu/disclaimer in user home to avoid warning
	if [ ! -d $HOME/.dosemu ]; then
	    mkdir $HOME/.dosemu
	fi
	if [ ! -f $HOME/.dosemu/disclaimer ]; then
	    touch $HOME/.dosemu/disclaimer
	fi
    fi
fi
</pre>
       The script rundoor.sh is never called directly, simply create 
       a link with the name of the door to this file, this name must be the 
       same as the one of the .bat file that starts the door in the doors directory 
       of the dos  partition. Let me explain this with an example:          
       <p> 
       I have chosen the door Virtual Sysop, but it could be any other 
       door. My experience says to me that not all doors work correctly with 
       a serial port in virtual mode. This one is working at Parolas BBS.
       <p> 
       Unpack Virtual Sysop in the dos partition, in the directory c:\doors\vsysop.
       Execute as user mbse 'sudo dosemu.bin' and make sure that the door
       works in local mode (these commands are for this door):
<pre>
cd doors
cd vsysop
vsysop -local
</pre>
       If everything is correct then create the file c:\doors\vsysop.bat 
       with the following contents:                                       
<pre>
--- vsysop.bat ---

@echo off
C:\COMUNIC\X00\X00 E B,0,57600
cd vsysop
vsysop -D c:\doors\node%1\door.sys -BBSNAME PAROLAS
deltree /y c:\doors\node%1
C:\COMUNIC\X00\X00
cd ..
</pre>
       Before passing the control to dosemu, the file door.sys will
       be  copied to c:\doors\node???? where the ???? is the node number from
       which  the door is  invoked (to allow that several users can execute the
       door at the same time).  This nodenumber also is passed as the first parameters 
       to the .bat file, this is to indicate to which directory to copy the door.sys
       file.                                                                 
       <p> 
       The Virtual Sysop door supports door.sys and that is the only 
       dropfile that is generated by mbsebbs and that is supported by most 
       of the doors. If you need another format you must use a converter to change
       the format of the dropfile.
       <p> 
       I use the fossil X00, I have it installed in C:\COMUNIC\X00 and 
       this door works for me correctly with these parameters, it is alos possible
       that it works without X00 or that you can load another fossil.    
       <p> 
       Now create a link to rundoor.sh in /opt/mbse/bin called vsysop. 
       The name must be the same one that the name of the .bat file created 
       in the dos partition, but without the extension bat.
<pre>
ln -s /opt/mbse/bin/rundoor.sh /opt/mbse/bin/vsysop
</pre>
       Now we execute mbsetup and enter the menu setup to add an entrance
       like this (It puts option 16 to Yes):

       Dosemu still exhibits some file locking behaviour and this needs 
       to be overcome, especially if you are running multinode door games. The
       following information  was supplied by Bob Newell of Chung Kuo BBS (telnet
       chungkuo.org) and I reiterate it here.                            
       <p> 
       There is an issue in that GNU/Linux file locking does not map precisely 
       to DOS file locking. You need to patch DOSEMU and build a special version
       to deal with this problem. Find the file "dosext/mfs/mfs.c" in your
       DOSEMU source tree. Locate the following lines:
<pre>
case DENY_ANY:
fl.l_type = F_RDLCK;

Change the second line to 
fl.l_type = !writing ? F_RDLCK : F_WRLCK;
</pre>
       and build a new version of DOSEMU.                        
       <p> 
       To solve a problem of slow screen painting, locate "base/async/int.c" 
       in your source tree. Locate
<pre>
case 0x2C:

and just below, comment out or delete the line

usleep(INT2F_IDLE_USECS);
</pre>
       and rebuild your DOSEMU.
       <br>
       It is recommended to use both tips above as it will not harm 
       any dos door games.</td>

       There are 2 methods for providing InterBBS setup. If your system 
       merely connects to one host for your games packets you need only perform 
       a few simple steps to have it working. If your system is a Host for InterBBS
       games  you will also need to add a script to separate different packets
       for different downlink systems.
       <p>
       Common to Both Methods:<br>
       With most BBS games you will need 2 directories in your dos
       filesystem area. One for the inbound packets and one for netmail messages
       door games produce to send outbound packets.                       
       <p> 
       The easiest way to solve this is by creating symlinks from your 
       MBSE directories into the directory where your dos doors live (c:\doors). 
       The 2 directories you wish to link are /opt/mbse/var/inbound and /opt/mbse/var/msgs 
       - link them into your dos directories doors directory with the same 
       names ie: "inbound" and "msgs". Now according to dosemu you will have 
       a c:\doors\inbound and a c:\doors\msgs. We do not actually use the "msgs" 
       directory for anything other than a place to tell games where to write 
       its netmails to. These "netmails" are subsequently deleted from the system, 
       but the games need to be able to write them there.
       <p>
       1. The Easy Way - Single Host System:<br>
       <p>
       1A. First of all you will realise that door games running under 
       dosemu usually write files as owner root, chmod 0644. This is not good 
       for MBSE to transfer these files as it does not have permission to act 
       on the files. In order to force dosemu to write games files so that MBSE 
       can act upon them we need to alter /etc/sudoers and change the umask for
       root running under sudo. To do this open /etc/sudoers (you must be root
       to edit this file) and add the following line at the top of the file before
       the specifications:
       <p>
       Defaults &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; umask=0000</p>
       <p>
       This will allow dosemu to write files chmod 0666 (read/write everybody) 
       and MBSE will be able to manipulate them.
       <p> 
       For my example I will use the InterBBS dos door game called Barren
       Realms Elite (BRE for short).
       <p> 
       1B. Install Bre in c:\doors\bre and setup the necessary files 
       for its execution as a dos door from MBSE as per the dos doors faq. 
       <p> 
       1C. Tell Bre (in its BBS.CFG) that the path for inbound packets 
       is c:\doors\inbound and the netmail path is c:\doors\msgs Bre will now
       automatically process all inbound packets it finds in the inbound directory
       for itself. It needs no assistance as it merely searches for the correct
       filename in the directory.
       <p>
       1D. We need to link Bre's outbound path to our host nodes MBSE 
       mailbox for automatic transfer of games packets. First make sure you 
       have added an "outbox" for your uplink node in the nodes setup in MBSE 
       - Section 7, Select Uplink, Menu 1, Section 2 "outbox dir". eg: if your 
       uplink is 3:640/954  then MBSE will default to creating /opt/mbse/var/boxes/node3_640_954 
       as the  outbox (I will use this as an example). Note the flavour of your 
       uplinks node connection will apply to the outbox as well. Thus if that 
       particular node is set crashmail then anything you put in the outbox will
       also be sent crashmail.
       <p>
       Next go to your Bre game directory. You will notice Bre has an 
       OUTBOUND directory, this is where it places all its game packets that 
       are to be sent to the uplink. We need to delete this directory and instead 
       create a symlink to the node outbox instead. If Bre is in c:\doors\bre 
       then the symlink command will be:
       <p>
       ln -s /opt/mbse/var/boxes/node3_640_954 /dos/c/doors/bre/OUTBOUND
       <p>
       Alter the above depending on where your linux path to your dos 
       is, also remember linux is case sensitive! Note you can also make as 
       many symlinks as you like to the nodes outbox, so if you have 2 or 3 
       different games you send to that node you can link the outbox to each 
       games outbound directory. Also if you have different games to different 
       host nodes just link the game outbound directories to the outboxes of each
       node.
       <p>
       Thats it. The system will now process inbound and outbound packets 
       automatically. You will however need to delete the netmails in the msgs
       directory - I have included this in the Door game maintenance section 
       further on.
       <p> 
       If you experience problems with your system polling nodes and
       sending the game mail packets while a user is online within the game then
       you might wish to use the dos "share.exe" so packet files are not being accessed
       by both the game and the mailer at the same time. You can load share.exe
       within your doors.bat in dos root directory.
       <p> 
       2. The Hard Way - Multiple Host System
       <p>
       Follow steps 1A, 1B, 1C above, the change occurs for 1D (below).
       <p> 
       1D. We need a script to process the Bre outbound packets and add
       them to MBSE's node outboxes path so they are sent. A script on how to do
       this  follows (with comments ). First remember to create your outboxes for
       each node that you transfer games packets to. I will use 3:640/954 as above
       and 1:123/456 for this example of 2 systems linked to the one Bre game. 
       <p> 
       This script should be owned by user "mbse" and have the permissions
       (chmod 755) -rwxr-xr-x. It is best kept in /opt/mbse/bin with your
       dos game executing scripts. I call this script "dos_poll"
<pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl -U
use File::Basename;
use File::Copy;

# Define the variables for the outboxes for our links
$node1 = "/opt/mbse/var/boxes/node3_640_954";
$node2 = "/opt/mbse/var/boxes/node1_123_456";
# Define the linux path to Bre's outbound directory
$bre_path = "/opt/mbse/dos/doors/bre/OUTBOUND";

opendir(DIR, "$bre_path") || die;
@dirlist = readdir(DIR);
closedir(DIR);

foreach $filename (@dirlist){
    $brefile = "$bre_path/$filename";
    ($filenameOnly, $pathname, $fileExtension) = fileparse($filename, '\..*');
    
    if($filenameOnly eq "048b0201") {
        move("$brefile","$node1"); 
    }
    if($filenameOnly eq "048b0203") {
        move("$brefile","$node2"); 
    }
}

# '048b0201' is the packet name Bre creates. You can find out what
# your packet name is by running BRE PLANETARY and then checking inside
# the Bre OUTBOUND directory - note no ext on name. You should also check
# your nodes dat for which is which 048b0201 means from system 2 to system 1
# so you would be system 2 in the nodes dat and 1 would be 3:640/954
# 048b0203 is obviously to system 3 in the nodes dat - 1:/123/456 in our
# example here

------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
       Thats it. You can run this 'dos_poll' script from the maintenance scripts described below.</td>

       Ok, so you can setup doors, run inbound and outbound for interbbs
       games. So how do you do maintenance? <br>
       Again by scripts. Again I will use BRE as an example. First 
       I  create a  maintenance batch file in my C: root directory. I have called 
       it maint.bat and for the bre game it looks like this:               
<pre>
cd \doors\bre
BRE INBOUND
BRE SCORES
BRE REQUEST
BRE PLANETARY
exitemu
</pre>
       if you are familiar with Bre you will know this to be a standard
       sort of  maintenance except for the "exitemu" at the end. That is there
       because we are going to use a script to start dosemu and call the maint.bat
       - so afterwards we need it to exit dosemu. <br>
       Now a maintenance script to be called from your cron or whatever
       else you  are using to execute events on your system. I call this script
       "dos_maint" and it also lives in /opt/mbse/bin
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
#
COMMANDO="\" maint \r\""
/usr/bin/sudo dosemu -dumb -E dir &gt; /opt/mbse/log/dos.log -quiet -I "`echo keystroke $COMMANDO`"
/bin/rm /opt/mbse/var/msgs/*.msg
#/opt/mbse/bin/dos_poll # Uncomment this line&nbsp;if you are using the Multiple host script
</pre>
       You will notice this script starts dosemu and calls maint.bat,
       and   then   when its finished there it deletes all those games netmails
       and if   you run   the script for multiple hosts for your games it can call
       that as  well. Please   note the second line is all ONE line, it has most
       probably   wrapped here.                                               
       <p> 
       You will notice that the script calls dosemu and not dosemu.bin, 
       this is because we need to tell dosemu to open a dumb terminal and not
       display   to a console or screen. By use of the redirection we redirect 
       the  normal  console output to a file, here I have used /opt/mbse/log/dos.log 
       as that is where all of MBSE's other logs reside.
       <p> 
       Once "dos_maint" is run via the cron it will run maintenance on
       your dos doors, process inbound/outbound interBBS game packets and have your
       outbound packets ready to send. Thats about all there is to do :)
       <p>
       Note: You can make variants on these scripts for running daily 
       maintenance or just packet processing at certain times of day. They 
       are just variations on the information above, but if you have questions, 
       contact me!
       <p> 
       Have fun! </td>
