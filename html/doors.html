<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Running DOS doors is possible on systems that can run 
<a href="http://www.dosemu.org" rel="nofollow">dosemu</a>. The latest versions of dosemu don't
need to be started suid root or started using sudo, it can run as the user that
is logged in the bbs. Since that is possible, a new location for the virtual C:
drive is now being used withing the $FTND_ROOT file structure. This virtual C:
drive is owned by the group bbs. The basic ideas how doors should be run written
by Redy Rodriguez are still valid, but some scripts are changed and some dosemu
files must be copied into the ftnd directory tree.<p>
<em>One very important note: the virtual dos drive is now $FTND_ROOT/var/dosemu/c
Don't use another location or change the access rights, there will be several 
references from ftnd to that and only that location for dos support. 
Choose another one and you are on your own!</em>
<p>&nbsp;<p>

<h3>Installing dosemu</h3>
<p>
Some distributions have good dosemu packages, others don't. You need a dosemu
that can be used in a systemwide multiuser setup. The bad packages want to have
the dos drive in each users home directory, this is not what we want for doors.
If you don't have a good dosemu you have to compile your own. This is not too
complicated. First download the source from <a
href="http://www.dosemu.org" rel="nofollow">dosemu</a>. You don't need the freedos-bin source
if you are going to use ms-dos or pc-dos. 
Unpack the source in some directory of your choice and compile the sources:<br>
<pre>
mbse@seaport$ tar xfvz dosemu-1.2.2.tgz
mbse@seaport$ cd dosemu-1.2.2
mbse@seaport:~/dosemu-1.2.2$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc/dosemu --with-x
mbse@seaport:~/dosemu-1.2.2$ make
</pre>
Note that the <code>--with-x</code> is not needed for running doors, but it
might be handy that you can use dosemu as user ftnd in X to do maintenance on
your doors.<br>
Then as root do:<br>
<pre>
root@seaport:~/dosemu-1.2.2# make install
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;<p>

<h3>Setup dosemu in ftnd</h3>
<p>
First copy <code>/etc/dosemu/dosemu.conf</code> into <code>~/etc/dosmeu</code>.
Then edit <code>~/etc/dosemu/dosemu.conf</code> so that we have a version for
ftnd users. Set the following settings in that file:<br>
<pre>
$_hdimage = "/opt/ftnd/var/dosemu/c"
$_floppy_a = ""
$_xms = (1024)
$_ems = (2048)
$_dpmi = (0x1000)
$_layout = "us"
</pre>
Next copy this new file as <code>virtual.conf</code> in
<code>~/etc/dosemu/</code>. Then add the following line:
<pre>
$_com1 = "virtual"
</pre>
Note that in older dosemu versions you could use a commandline option to do
this, but this isn't supported anymore since dosemu-1.2.x. The
<code>rundoor.sh</code> now also uses two configuration files.<br>
Next we need to setup the C: drive. Do this as user ftnd. First type <code>umask
007</code>, this sets the create mode for directories to 0770 and files to 0660
so that we create all files and directories read/write for all bbs users. This
is very important! Type the following commands:
<pre>
mbse@seaport:~$ umask 007
mbse@seaport:~$ cd var/dosemu/c
mbse@seaport:~/var/dosemu/c$ mkdir dos dosemu temp util doors
</pre>
Now we must install dos. If you use ms-dos then in <code>~/var/dosemu/c</code>
copy the ms-dos files <code>command.com</code>, <code>io.sys</code> and
<code>msdos.sys</code>. In <code>~/var/dosemu/c/dos</code> copy all ms-dos
commands. Next install the dosemu utilities, copy these from
<code>/usr/share/dosemu/freedos/dosemu</code> to
<code>~/var/dosemu/c/dosemu</code>. Now there is a empty
<code>~/var/dosemu/c/util</code>, copy some utilities here such as your
favourite dos editor, zip and unzip etc.<br>
Next we must create <code>config.sys</code> and <code>autoexec.bat</code>. These
files must be dos crlf formatted. You can do that with the joe editor, for
example <code>joe -crlf config.sys</code>. Examples:<br>
<pre>
config.sys:

BUFFERS = 20
DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
SET TEMP=C:\TEMP
DOS=HIGH,UMB
FILES=50

autoexec.bat:

@ECHO OFF
PROMPT $P$G
PATH C:\DOSEMU;C:\DOS;C:\UTIL;
SET TEMP=C:\TEMP
Lh C:\DOS\DOSKEY /INSERT
Lh C:\DOS\SHARE
</pre>
Now we are ready to try it, type <code>ftnddos</code> and the dos emulator
should start. You can leave dosemu with the command <code>exitemu</code>.
<p>&nbsp;</P>

<h3>Installing a door</h3>
<p>
All doors are started using the script <code>~/bin/rundoor.sh</code>. This script
is never started directly, you should make a copy of that with the name of the
door, but the best solution is to make a symlink with the name of the door. For
example:<br>
<pre>
mbse@seaport$ cd ~/bin
mbse@seaport:~bin$ ln -s rundoor.sh 8ball
</pre>
See also inside <code>rundoor.sh</code> for the instructions. This file does
several things, first it prepares the users home directory with the dosemu
environment so that dosemu will run for the user. Then it creates a node
directory in the dos C: drive and copies the door dropfiles into that node
directory. Finally it starts dosemu in virtual comport mode and inserts the
commands in dos to start the door.<br>
But before we can run the door, the door itself must be installed in the dos
partition. In this example I will explain how to install the door 8ball.
Start <code>ftnddos</code> and create a directory <code>c:\doors\8ball</code>.
Unpack 8ball in that directory and run <code>setup</code>. Test the door with
the command <code>local</code>. Now goto the directory <code>c:\doors</code> and
create the file <code>8ball.bat</code>. That file will be used to start the
door. It will be called by <code>c:\doors.bat</code> with two parameters, the
name of the door and the nodenumber.
<pre>
@ECHO OFF
C:
C:\UTIL\X00 E B,0,57600
CD \DOORS\8BALL
ASKME.EXE /E /C1 /PC:\DOORS\NODE%1
C:\UTIL\X00
CD \DOORS\NODE%1
DEL DOOR.SYS
DEL DOOR32.SYS
</pre>
Finally we have to make a menu entry to start the door. The Opt. Data line is
the command to start the door, the optional <code>/N</code> is replaced by the
current nodenumber of the user. A second option may be used,
<code>novirtual</code>, if that is present the <code>rundoor.sh</code> will
start dosemu without setting the comport in virtual mode. Use this if your door
isn't a real door but a normal dos program.
<p>

Note that I use the
Display lines to make the menu, there are only ansi screens for the top and
common lines on the screen, see the second image how to build the whole doors
menu.

<h3>Netmail support</h3>
<p>
In the virtual c: drive you need some directories that point to several other
ftnd subdirectories. You may need at least three of them, one to put netmail in,
one to put files in to send and one semafore directory to tell ftnd there is
something to send. For example like this:
<pre>
ln -s /opt/ftnd/var/msgs /opt/ftnd/var/dosemu/c/msgs
ln -s /opt/ftnd/var/boxes/node92_100_60 /opt/ftnd/var/dosemu/c/outbox
ln -s /opt/ftnd/var/sema /opt/ftnd/var/dosemu/c/sema
</pre>
In dos you now have:
<pre>
C:\MSGS
C:\OUTBOX
C:\SEMA
</pre>
In <code>C:\MSGS</code> doors may put *.msg netmails. 
File attaches won't work from these netmails because the netmails
point to files with dosnames. (May be solved later). The script that calls the
door, for example <code>c:\doors\bre.bat</code> must copy the file to send to
the node outbound box. In the above example that would be copy to 
<code>C:\OUTBOX</code>.
To create the semafore to tell ftnd to scan add to the batfile (for example
<code>C:\DOORS\BRE.BAT</code> the following two lines:
<pre>
CD C:\SEMA
ECHO ""&gt;MAILOUT
</pre>
See also the <a href="faq.html#_Doors">F.A.Q.</a> for some very usefull tips and
tricks.
Using the same method with symlinks, you can make all paths you need from the
rest of ftnd visible in dos. Use with care.
<p>&nbsp;<p>

<h3>What if I don't upgrade</h3>
<p>
That's your choice, but for a while the old method starting dosemu via sudo is
still supported. The file <code>~/bin/bbsdoor.sh</code> is still there, but the
file <code>~/bin/rundoor.sh</code> is renamed to
<code>~/bin/runvirtual.sh</code>. So you should change all symlinks of your door
names in <code>~/bin</code> (or copies) to <code>~/bin/runvirtual.sh</code>. You
should not need to change anything else.
<p>

<h3>Problems</h3>
<p>
Currently there are some troubles with modem calls.
