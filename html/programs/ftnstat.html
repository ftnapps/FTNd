<H3>Synopsis.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>ftnstat</strong> [commands] &lt;options&gt;</code>
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Description.</H3>
<P>
<strong>ftnstat</strong> changes the bbs status between open and close, can wait
for all users to logoff and wait for critical utilities to stop their actions.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Environment.</H3>
<P>
In order to run <strong>ftnstat</strong> you must set the global variable
<strong>$FTND_ROOT</strong>. This variable must point to the root directory
of the bbs structure. The main configuration file <strong>config.data</strong>
must be present in the ~/etc directory.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Commands.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>ftnstat</strong> semafore scanout</code> will set the internal
semafore <i>scanout</i> in the <b>ftntask</b> daemon. The following semafore's 
are valid: scanout, mailout, mailin, ftnindex, reqindex, msglink.
<P>
<code><strong>ftnstat</strong> close</code> will close the bbs for users.
Users that are just logging in to the bbs will be thrown out after a short message. 
Users already logged in will be thrown out when they pass by a menu prompt. 
So users who are doing file transfers can finish their transfers before being disconnected.
<P>
<code><strong>ftnstat</strong> open</code> opens the bbs for users. 
This should be run from one of the system startup scripts right after you started 
<strong>ftnsed</strong>. If you installed everything as it should this 
command is already executed at system startup.
<P>
<code><strong>ftnstat</strong> wait</code> will
wait for the bbs to become free. This includes a check for utilities that
do critical actions so they can finish their job without corrupting the bbs
databases. The default is to wait 60 minutes. If the semafore
<strong>upsdown</strong> exists it will wait only 30 seconds.
<P>
You should run <strong>ftnstat close wait</strong> in your system shutdown script so
that the system shutdown will wait for a clean shutdown of the bbs before
the rest of your system goes down. If you installed everything as it should
be then these commands are already installed in your system shutdown scripts.
<P>

<H3>Options.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>ftnstat</strong> [command] -quiet</code> will supress screen output. 
This is good for using ftnstat in scripts.
