<H3>Synopsis.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>mbout</strong> [command] &lt;params&gt; &lt;options&gt;</code>
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Description.</H3>
<P>
<strong>mbout</strong> is the outbound manager for MBSE BBS. It can ask 
information from the nodelists, create and remove polls, request and send files and
display the outbound status. Most of the tasks such as create and remove 
polls should be done from the crontab.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Environment.</H3>
<P>
In order to run <strong>mbout</strong> you must set the global variable
<strong>$MBSE_ROOT</strong>. This variable must point to the root directory
of the bbs structure. The main configuration file <strong>config.data</strong>
must be present in the ~/etc directory.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Commands.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>mbout</strong> att &lt;node&gt; &lt;flavor&gt; &lt;file&gt;</code> will attach
the specified file to the specified node. The node should be in the format
f2802.n280.z2, flavor should be crash, immediate, normal or hold. Only the first
letter of the flavor parameter is needed.
If the node is not in the nodelist, the status is Down or Hold, then this command fails. 
To non-CM nodes you mus use the <strong>Immediate</strong> flavor if you want to send the file direct. 
The flavors Hold and Normal are still allowed. The file must be in the directory range
from where file attaches are allowed.
<P>
<code><strong>mbout</strong> poll [node..node]</code> creates poll requests in the outbound
for one or more nodes. The node should be in the format f2802.n280.z2. The semafore 
<strong>scanout</strong> is created so that the mailer will start calling. 
The mailer will handle the poll request as if it should deliver immediate mail, 
so the node will be called as long as the poll request exists, even to nodes which are not CM. 
The error counter for the node to poll will be reset to zero, so a node that was
previous marked undialable will be called again.
If a call to a node is successfull, the poll file will be removed by <strong>mbcico</strong>. 
If a node is not in the nodelist or has the status Down or Hold, no poll will be created for that node.
<P>
<code><strong>mbout</strong> stop [node..node]</code> removes poll requests that are 
leftover when polling nodes didn't succeed. There is no check if the node is
in the nodelist or has the status Down or Hold, the poll is always removed.
<P>
<code><strong>mbout</strong> req &lt;node&gt; &lt;file&gt; [file..file]</code> creates
filerequests to a node. One or more filenames may be given including wildcards.
It is not possible to do update or password protected uploads yet. If there
is already a requestlist for that node, the new requests will be added. This
command does not call a node, you need to create a poll request to make the
actual call. This is also practical if you want some files from your uplink,
just make the requests and the actual request is send when your normal 
scheduled poll to your uplink is processed.
<P>
<code><strong>mbout</strong> reset [node..node]</code> resets the nodes "try"
counter to zero. So if a node is undiable, the counter is 30 or more, then by
resetting this counter that node will be called again. The outbound is rescanned
after this command so that calling will start immediatly.
<P>
<code><strong>mbout</strong> stat</code> shows the status of the mailer outbound. 
This status is also written to the logfile.
<P>
<code><strong>mbout</strong> node &lt;node&gt;</code> will show the nodelist information for
a certain node.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Options.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>mbout</strong> [commands] -quiet</code> will suppress screen output. This is
usefull if you run <strong>mbout</strong> from the crontab or from background
scripts.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Examples.</H3>
<P>
This is an example of crontab entries that writes the outbound status to the
logfile and creates and stops polling of 2 nodes.<br>
<pre>
00 00 * * * export MBSE_ROOT=/opt/mbse; $MBSE_ROOT/bin/mbout stat -quiet
00 01 * * * export MBSE_ROOT=/opt/mbse; $MBSE_ROOT/bin/mbout poll f98.n100.z92 f0.n100.z92 -quiet
00 02 * * * export MBSE_ROOT=/opt/mbse; $MBSE_ROOT/bin/mbout stop f98.n100.z92 f0.n100.z92 -quiet
