<H3>Synopsys.</H3>
<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> [commands] &lt;options&gt;</code>
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Description.</H3>
<P>
<strong>ftnfile</strong>
is the filedatabase maintenance program for FTNd. In order to run ftnfile you
must have started <strong>ftnsed</strong>,
this is the deamon which controls all bbs activities.
<P>
The main purpose of <strong>ftnfile</strong>
to do automatic maintenance on the downloadable files on the bbs, such as
removing or moving old files, checking the database and packing the database.
The best way to do the maintenance is to run <strong>ftnfile</strong>
from the crontab. example:
<P><pre>
30 05 * * * export FTND_ROOT=/opt/ftnse; /opt/ftnse/bin/ftnfile kill pack index -quiet
</pre>
Other functions in <b>ftnfile</b> are meant to do manual maintenance such as
adding, deleting or moving files.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Environment.</H3>
<P>
In order to run the bbs you need to set one global environment variable
<strong>$FTND_ROOT</strong>
This variable must point to the root of the bbs directory structure. The
main configuration file <strong>config.data</strong>
must exist in the subdirectory ~/etc.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Commands.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> adopt &lt;area&gt; &lt;file&gt; "[description]"</code>
Adopt a file to the filebase. The description is optional, but if present it
should be enclosed in quotes. The optional description may be at most 255 characters.
Default ftnfile will try to use the FILE_ID.DIZ if this is present. The file to
adopt needs to be in your current directory and will be copied to the new area.
If you have virus scanners defined, the file will be checked for virusses. 

<P>
<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> check [area]</code>
Check the database integrity. All files in the filedatabase must exist on
disk and all files on disk must exist in the filedatabase. There are some
exceptions, files.bbs, files.bak, 00index, index*.html, header, readme and 
files that start with a dot. 
Of all files the date and time is checked, the size and the crc
value of the file. If there is something wrong, the error is corrected or the
file is removed. If the area is a CD-rom area, the check that files on disk
must exist in the filedatabase is skipped.
If no area nuftner is given, all areas are checked.
<P>

<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> delete &lt;area&gt; "&lt;filemask&gt;"</code>
Mark file(s) in an area for later deletion. You can use wildcards, and if you do
surround them with quotes to prevent shell expansion.
The file is not removed until you run <strong>ftnfile pack</strong>.
<P>

<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> import &lt;area&gt;</code>
Import files to the given area using files.bbs descriptions. There are two
possibilities, import from CD-rom or just from a temporary directory.
<UL>
 <LI>Import from a temporary directory: Put the files to import there including the
files.bbs file.
 <LI>Import from CD-rom: Go into the directory on the CD
where the files are. If the files.bbs is not in the same directory, 
you must enter the full filename and path where the files.bbs is with
<b>ftnsetup</b> 8.4.area.6.
</UL>
To start the import, type <code>ftnfile import area</code> where area is the
nuftner of the destination filearea.
The files are not checked for FILE_ID.DIZ inside the
archives. If you have virus scanners defined, the files are checked for 
virusses before they are added the the bbs. If you don't want these fresh files
to be announced, add the <code>-announce</code> option on the commandline. This
may be a good idea if you migrate from another bbs system.
<P>

<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> index</code>
Create fast filerequest index for the <strong>ftncico</strong> filerequest
processor. In each directory with the downloadable files is also a 
<strong>files.bbs</strong> file written in msdos cr/lf format. This includes a
download counter.
Also, if defined, in each available download area for ftp/http, <b>00index</b>
and <b>index.html</b> files are
created, starting at the ftp pub directory. If the area contains gif or jpg
images, thumbnails are created using the <b>convert</b> program if you have that
installed. The thumbnails have the same filenames as the original images, only
they start with a dot. The convert command is defined with <b>ftnsetup</b> menu
1.19.8, if you don't have it or don't want thumbnails, make that entry empty.
The index command only rebuilds area index files (files.bbs, index.html and
00index) when there was a change in the area. 
<P>

<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> kill</code>
Mark files to delete or move files in areas that have the <strong>download age</strong>
set or the <strong>filedate age</strong> set. A setting of 0 is ignored.
Areas on CD-rom are always skipped.
If the Move to Area option is set the files are moved to the given area. The
upload date and download date are reset to the current date and time.
So if you set in the destination area aging of 14 days, files will stay
there for 14 days after the move. This is good for automatic "last chance" areas.
<P>

<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> list [area]</code>
List all defined file areas, the number of files, the total size of the files
and the primary group. If and area is given on the commandline, the files in
that area are listed.
<P>

<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> move &lt;from&gt; &lt;to&gt; &lt;file&gt;</code>
This command will move a file from one area to another. No actions on the file
are performed.
<P>

<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> pack</code>
This command will actualy remove the records of files that are marked for
deletion. If the file is still on disk, it will be removed also. So when
you delete files with ftnsetup or with ftnfile, they are still in your database and on disk
until you run <strong>ftnfile pack</strong>.
<P>

<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> rearc &lt;area&gt; "&lt;filemask&gt;"</code>;
Re-archive file(s) in an file area to the archiver that must be set in the
<a href="../setup/files.html">file area setup</a>.
<P>

<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> sort &lt;area&gt;</code>
Sort the files in area on the long filenames. The sort is case insensitive. When
the sort is completed, the command <strong>ftnfile index</strong> will automatic
run to rebuild all indexes.
<P>

<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> toberep</code>
Shows which files are to be reported. This lists only the files that are
received during .tic processing, new uploaded files are not displayed. This list
is automatic removed after newfiles are announced.
See also <A HREF="ftntoberep.html">ftntoberep</A>.
<P>

<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> undelete &lt;area&gt; "&lt;filemask&gt;"</code>
Mark a file that is marked for deletion to be available again, ie. undo the deletion
mark. You can use wildcards, and if you do
surround them with quotes to prevent shell expansion.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Options.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> [command] -quiet</code>
Quiet mode, no screen output. Use this switch if you run <strong>ftnfile</strong> from the crontab.
<P>
<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> [command] -announce</code>
Announce mode, use this switch with the adopt and import commands to prevent
that the added file(s) will be announced. This can be usefull if you add lots of
files that you don't want to announce these as new files.
<P>
<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> [command] -force</code>
With the adopt, import and move commands files that already exist in the
destination area are not overwritten. With this switch you can force to
overwrite the existing file.
<P>
<code><strong>ftnfile</strong> [command] -virus</code>
Supress virus scanning of files during adopt or import. Use with care.
