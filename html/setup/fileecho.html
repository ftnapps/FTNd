<H3>Introduction.</H3>
<P>
In this setup you can define the File Echo's or TIC areas. Files received or
send from this areas are bound together with a *.tic file with information
about the file and where to store that file. Each file echo must belong to a
group, in this grouprecord is the information about costsharing and some
other details. When a file is received at your system you can do several
things with that file before it is stored in your download areas such as;
scanning the file for virusses, extracting the FILE_ID.DIZ file to use as
description, allow update of magic alias, convert to another compression
format, replace the file archive comment with an add of your own bbs and limit
the number of files (nodelists).

<H3>Global Commands.</H3>
<P>
From menu 10.2 you can enter the global commands menu. In this menu you can:
<ol>
 <li>Delete connection
 <li>Add new connection
 <li>Replace connection
 <li>Change connection status
 <li>Change aka to use
 <li>Change security flags
 <li>Delete TIC area
</ol>
After you have selected the action you want and added the items to do, you will see
a screen were you can select TIC file area groups. You can then tag one or more
groups and press enter when you are done. Then you have one chance to perform the
actions or to bail out. All areas matching in that group are affected by your
changes. If you are not happy with the result, don't save the database and no
harm is done. The file mbsetup.log shows all affected areas.
