<H3>Introduction.</H3>
<P>
File echo groups are to logically divide your file echo's for different 
file distribution networks. 
This screen also has a lot of fields that are needed for the auto area create.
When a new area is created a bbs download area is made and a new tic area record
is made.
It makes sense to select the groups by uplink and
area file that is available for that file distribution network. By doing that 
downlinks can connect areas that are not yet connected at your bbs but are
available from your uplink. If you are connected to the filegate then there is
one area file for all distribution groups. You must then create a file group for
each distribution group, ie. Fidonet, SDS etc. The name of that group must
exactly match the comment field in the group in this setup.
