<H3>Introduction.</H3>
<P>
Magics are special actions that you can perform on files received in a .tic
area. The actions are: copy file to a directory, unpack file in a directory,
set number of files to keep, move file to another .tic area, update magic
request alias, adopt file into another area, store in another path, 
delete file (don't process it further) and execute a command. The edit screen
is different for all kinds of actions you select. More than one magic record
may exist for each area. With all these actions you can for example can setup 
processing of nodediff's and unpacking nodelists in the nodelist directory.
If you use the execute command, you can only execute commands that are in the
directory $MBSE_ROOT/bin, ie. /opt/mbse/bin.
