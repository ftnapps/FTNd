<H3>File Areas introduction.</H3>
<P>
This is the setup for the file areas in which users can up and download files.
This database has fixed area numbers, the database can't be packed.
Extending the database is allways possible. One important note,
before you can set this up, you need to define the 
<A HREF="newgroups.html">newfiles groups</A>.
<P>
If you change the path in an existing area, all files in that area are automatic
moved to the new location.
