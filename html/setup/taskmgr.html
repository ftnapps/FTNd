<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
The task manager is the daemon which controls the MBSE BBS. It watches semafore's and spawns
programs in the background. It also watches the outbound to see if there are
nodes to call.
The behaviour is setup in this screen.
<P>

<P>
Default are the original MBSE commands filled in, but you could also call
shell scripts.
<P>
The two IP addresses to ping need to be IP addresses, not hostnames. This is the
most reliable way to check the connection. You should enter the IP addresses of
the nameservers of your own ISP here. One of these will always be up, so if one 
of these can be reached, the internet connection is assumed to be alive. The
status of the internet connection is used to decide if it is allowed (and
possible) to call TCP/IP nodes. Calling these nodes is not depending on ZMH
unless the destination is not a CM node.<br>
The <b>max load</b> setting decides at which system load point processing of background
tasks will be suspended. The default value should be allright for machines slower then 200
MHz or with low ram. On faster machines you may set this value higher.
