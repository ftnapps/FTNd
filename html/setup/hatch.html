<H3>Introduction.</H3>
<P>
Hatch files is nothing more than entering a new file into a file echo. That
file is searched for on your system in a specific directory with a certain
filemask. This can be for example a new created nodelist or an allfiles listing.
Everytime <strong>mbfido tic</strong> is run it will scan for files defined
in this setup. If such a file is found, a special .tic file is written and 
stored in the mailers inbound directory. When the <strong>mbfido</strong>
starts processing .tic files, that new hatched file will be processed as if
it was received form another system. To let this work, you obviously need
an existing TIC area.<P>
The filenames to hatch may be long filenames as long as there are no spaces in
it. In the TIC file a short filename will be created for the old style tic
processors. The long filename is inserted in the TIC file as well. The short
filenames are created in the same way as windows does.

<strong>Dupe    </strong>Check for duplicates.
<strong>Active  </strong>If this area is active.
