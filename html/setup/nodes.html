<P>

<h3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
Unlike many other bbs packages, for each node you need only one record. If you
have a relation with a node for one network with costsharing, and other 
networks without costsharing you need two records for that node. For each node
you can setup the aka's, mail, files and session handshake. There are ten 
screens for each node.
<p>&nbsp;<p>

<H3>1. Edit general setup</H3>
<p>
This screen has the general information for the node. The contact info fields are
just for private use, these fields are only used in this screen. The Outbox dir is for
files to sent to the node, all file you put in there will be sent to the remote if
user mbse has read/write access to the file. Only real files are allowed, not symlinks etc.
<p><table>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Sysop name</th><td>The name of the system
operator. The name entered here is used in Areamgr and Filemgr messages etc.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Outbox dir</th><td>Private extra outbound
directory for this node. Any file dropped into this directory will be sent to
the node and removed after it is sent.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Pvt. phone</th><td>Contact info, node private
phone.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Pvt. fax</th><td>Contact info, node private
fax.</td></tr>

address.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Pvt. remark</th><td>Contact info, node
remark.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Route via</th><td>A route via Fido address. All
mail for this node will be send via this Aka, even mail and files for other
networks. This can be usefull if this node has internet access so you can send
everything to this node over the internet. Note that to force calling this node
via internetr, ISDN or pots can also be done by using nodelist flags override. See
section 3. This setting is more usefull to force routing via another node or
aka.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Netmail direct</th><td>Set "direct" flag in
netmail to this node.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Netmail crash</th><td>Send netmail always "crash"
to this node.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Netmail hold</th><td>Put mail on "hold" for this
node.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Pack mail</th><td>Should net- and echomail be packed in
arcmail archives.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Send notify</th><td>Send automatic generated
notify messages.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Language</th><td>The language to use for areamgr
msgs.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Deleted</th><td>If this node must be
deleted.</td></tr>

<H3>2. Edit nodes aka's</H3>
<p>
In this screen you can setup 20 aka's for the node.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../images/nodes2.png" alt="Nodes aka's setup">
<P>&nbsp;<p>

<H3>3. Edit node session</H3>
<p>
In this screen you can setup the session defaults.
<p><table>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Session passwd</th><td>This is the mailer
session password.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Dial command</th><td>You can put an
override here for the normal dial command. If you leave this empty the command

number to dial.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Phone number 2</th><td>An alternative phone
number to dial.  Use these above commands if the node has another
phone number as mentioned in the nodelist.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Nodelist flags</th><td>Override for the
nodelist flags, the nodelist flags are completly ignored if you enter something
here so make sure all flags you need are here. All aka's of this node will use
the same flags. This can be usefull to force calling this node via the
internet and to force a certain protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Inet hostname</th><td>The FQDN hostname or
IP address of this node. This replaces the original system name from the
nodelist and this is then used to make the internet TCP/IP connection. This can
be usefull if the FQDN is not present in the nodelist.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Outbound sess.</th><td>Outbound session
method, choices are <b>Direct</b> and <b>Directory</b>. Direct means normal
classic mailer connections. Directory means that everything is put in a
directory from which the other node can fetch the mail and files using ftp
protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Inbound sess.</th><td>Inbound session
method, choices are <b>Direct</b> and <b>Directory</b>. Direct means normal
classic mailer connections. Directory means that inbound mail and files are
expected in a directory were it is stored by the node using ftp
protocol.</td></tr>

spaces in the name or other special characters. Such known systems are Argus and
Irex upto 2.29. Others may exist, even some older mbse versions.
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>No binkp/1.1</th><td>Irex from version 2.24
at least upto 2.29 have a buggy binkp/1.1 implementation. Set this to Yes for
nodes that use one of these Irex versions and the binkp session will fall back
to the binkp/1.0 protocol.</td></tr>
<tr><th nowrap align=left valign=top>Ign. Hold</th><td>Ignore the nodelist flags

<H3>5. Edit mail groups</H3>
<P>
Here you can tag which mail groups are available for this node. Note that all
groups are visible here, even for networks this node has no aka's in. Be 
carefull not to allow a node to connect areas from networks he has no aka in.

<H3>7. File groups</H3>
<P>
The same story as for mail groups is true for the file groups.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/nodes7.png" alt='Nodes files groups'>
<P>&nbsp;<p>

<H3>8. Directory session</H3>
<P>
Setup in this screen is needed if you selected Inbound and or Outbound session
as Directory session. The node is then getting and bringing mail using the ftp
protocol and no normal mailer connects are being used anymore.
This may be a good solution for points, they only need a simple mailreader and a
tosser. The mail is transferred by the <b>mbfido</b> program, during the toss or
tic command after the normal inbound is processed <b>mbfido</b> will look for nodes inbound
directories to process. When mail is added to the outbound, mail for nodes with
directory sessions is not stored in the normal Binley Style Outbound but in the
session outbound directory.<br>
You need to setup a ftp account for this node and the best thing is to
set this up so that the other node is forced in a chroot environment, ie. make
it so that the node only sees his own directories and cannot leave that. The ftp
account needs to be a member of group bbs because mbfido needs access to the
files as well as the node. The nodes account needs also to be a member of group
bbsftp for the chroot environment.
The node needs umask 002 so that files that he puts
there will have group read/write access. During toss mbfido also stores the
files with group read/write access so that the node can remove the files when he
has fetched all files. Directory locking is supported and is compatible with
other mailers that support ftp. Here is a small sample of protftp.conf for use
with directory sessions:
<pre>
# This is /etc/proftpd.conf for use with mbsebbs ftp mail
# sessions and anonymous ftp access.
# It assumes that you have a user/group "nobody" and "ftp" 
# for normal/anonymous operation.
# It also assumes you have a group bbsftp were ftp mail users
# must be a member of.
#
ServerName			"Seaport ProFTPD server"
ServerType			inetd
DefaultServer			on
#
# Port 21 is the standard FTP port.
Port				21
# Umask 002 is to force new dirs and files to be group writable.
Umask				002
#
# To prevent DoS attacks, set the maximum number of child processes
# to 30.
MaxInstances			30
#
# Set the user and group that the server normally runs at.
User				nobody
Group				nogroup
#
SystemLog			/var/log/proftpd
TransferLog			/var/log/xferlog
#
# Anonymous ftp and members of group bbsftp have a chroot environment.
DefaultRoot	~ bbsftp
#
# Normally, we want files to be overwriteable.
&lt;Directory /*&gt;
  AllowOverwrite		on
&lt;/Directory&gt;
#
# A basic anonymous FTP server configuration.
# To enable this, remove the user ftp from /etc/ftpusers.
&lt;Anonymous ~ftp&gt;
  RequireValidShell		off
  User				ftp
  Group				ftp
  # We want clients to be able to login with "anonymous" as well as "ftp"
  UserAlias			anonymous ftp
  #
  # Limit the maximum number of anonymous logins
  MaxClients			50
  #
  # We want 'welcome.msg' displayed at login, and '.message' displayed
  # in each newly chdired directory.
  DisplayLogin			welcome.msg
  DisplayFirstChDir		.welcome
  DisplayReadme			README
  #
  # Display .dotfiles and .dirs
  LsDefaultOptions		"-a"
  #
  # Limit WRITE everywhere in the anonymous chroot
  &lt;Limit WRITE&gt;
    DenyAll
  &lt;/Limit&gt;
  #
  # An upload directory that allows storing files but not retrieving
  # or creating directories.
  &lt;Directory incoming/*&gt;
     &lt;Limit READ&gt;
       DenyAll
     &lt;/Limit&gt;

     &lt;Limit STOR&gt;
       AllowAll
     &lt;/Limit&gt;
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
  #
&lt;/Anonymous&gt;
</pre>
Here are some examples to create an account, first create the extra group
bbsftp:
<pre>
groupadd bbsftp
</pre>
Then create accounts like this:
<pre>
useradd -g bbs -G bbsftp -d /opt/mbse/var/bbsftp/irex -s /bin/bash -c "FTP Mail account" irex
</pre>
Then give the node a password for the ftp login. Note that this account has a
shell, proftpd needs a valid shell to allow access. If the node tries to telnet
to your bbs he can't login with this account if you use <b>mblogin</b>, this is
because the node is not in the bbs userfile. If you system allows it, the node
can access the shell using rlogin or ssh.<br>
Now the items to setup for the directory sessions:
