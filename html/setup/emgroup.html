<H3>Introduction.</H3>
<P>
Message Groups are to logically divide your echomail areas in groups for
different mail networks. It makes sense to select the groups by uplink, and
areas file that is available for each network. When you have defined a Areas
file and a message is received while you have no area for it, the area will be
created with the defaults that are set in the message area group. This will only
work if you receive a message from the uplink defined in this group, not from
any downlinks.
A note about the <b>Start at</b> area you can define, this may be higher then
your number of areas currently is. As soon as a area is created in this group
the areas database will be expanded so that it fits. Select these values
carefully, make sure you have room for all possible areas in that group and
skip a number of extra areas for future expansion.
