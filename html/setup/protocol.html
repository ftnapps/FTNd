<H3>Introduction.</H3>
<p>
MBSE BBS has Xmodem, Ymodem, Ymodem-1K, Ymodem-G, Zmodem and Zmodem-8K (aka
ZedZap) build in. In addition some external protocols are added to the setup but
they are disabled by default. When the bbs is started the first time, a set of
default protocols is created. The code used is based on the code from lrzsz
package wich is based in the original code written by Chuck Forsberg.
<p>
Ymodem is receiver driven. That means if the user has selected plain Ymodem at
the bbs and
his local client is using Ymodem-G and when the user starts a download, the files are
sent with Ymodem-G and not with plain Ymodem. With the same configuation an
upload will be sent with plain Ymodem. With downloads, the Ymodem at the bbs
will use what the client wants: 128 or 1K data blocks, crc of checksum, normal or
streaming Ymodem-G.
<p>
Zmodem is transmitter driven. That means if the user has selected Zmodem-8K at
the bbs and his local client is using normal Zmodem and when the user starts a
download, the download is sent with Zmodem-8K. With the same configuration an
upload will be sent with plain Zmodem. With uploads, the Zmodem at the bbs
doesn't care what is being used, it will adapt to the client program.
<p>
These days (2004) nobody should use Xmodem anymore but when I wrote Ymodem you
also get Xmodem because they are the same. Only with Xmodem the user has to
type in the filename to both sides. If you enable it you are on your own and you
may need to change the sources to make it really work because I didn't add
typing in the filename at the bbs. Also, Xmodem is restricted to 8.3 filenames
and the bbs uses long filenames.
