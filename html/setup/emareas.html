<H3>Introduction.</H3>
<P>
Mail areas have fixed area numbers, just like file areas. But if you want you
can move areas.
Some offline readers don't like changing the area numbers. All areas can
be of the following types: local, netmail, echomail and news. If you gate
news and echomail in the same area, then select echomail
if this area is a Fidonet area, select news if this area is a Usenet news area.
<P>
There is a global setup tool, if you are in the main message area setup screen then
you can choose the Global command. This will allow you to do bulk changes on areas
selected by the mail groups. Options are delete connection, add new connection, 
replace connection, change connection status, change days old for purge, change 
maximum messages for purge, change user security, change aka to use, change origin line,
change netmail reply board and delete message area.

<H3>Edit connection</H3>
<P>
<pre>
<strong>Aka         </strong>The network address.
<strong>Send to     </strong>Export mail to this node.
<strong>Recv from   </strong>Import mail form this node.
<strong>Pause       </strong>The node is temporary disconnected.
<strong>Excluded    </strong>The node is disconnected by the sysop.
<strong>Delete      </strong>Delete this connection.
</pre>
<P>
A note about the excluded switch. This can be used to disconnect a node
from the area by moderator request. AreaMgr requests from that node
for this area are not processed anymore, he cannot disconnect this area
and reconnect. 
If you want to block access to the area in a certain group for a node who has
access to the group you should use the Security flags and also set the correct
security flags for the node.
<P>&nbsp;<P>


<H3>Global Commands.</H3>
<P>
From menu 9.2 you can enter the global commands menu. In this menu you can:
<ol>
 <li>Delete connection
 <li>Add new connection
 <li>Replace connection
 <li>Change connection status
 <li>Change days old
 <li>Change max. messages
 <li>Change max. articles
 <li>Change bbs security
 <li>Change link security
 <li>Change aka to use
 <li>Change origin line
 <li>Change netmail reply
 <li>Delete message area
</ol>
After you have selected the action you want and added the items to do, you will see 
a screen were you can select message area groups. You can then tag one or more
groups and press enter when you are done. Then you have one chance to perform the
actions or to bail out. All areas matching in that group are affected by your
changes. If you are not happy with the result, don't save the database and no
harm is done. The file mbsetup.log shows all affected areas.
<P>&nbsp;<P>


<H3>Automatic area creation.</H3>
<P>
If you want to use the automatic area creation you have to define this in the
message area groups. This has been changed since MBSE BBS version 0.33.19.
