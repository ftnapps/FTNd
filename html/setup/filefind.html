<H3>Introduction.</H3>
<P>
The filefind idea on Fidonet came from the program Allfix written by Harald 
Harms. The idea is
that a user writes a mail in a filefind area addressed to "Allfix" with in the
subject line the items to search for. On all BBS'es with a filefind utility 
those programs try to find the requested files and then produce a reply of
which files they have found. That reply can be in the same area, in a special
reply echo or can be sent by netmail. Usually the user gets a lot of replies
from which he can see if someone has the file(s) available he was searching
for.
