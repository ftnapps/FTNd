<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The <strong>ftnfido</strong> program that is responsible for unpacking, 
importing, exporting and routing of netmail has a build in default routing
plan. In general this is quite simple, if we know the destination node or
his uplink, (that node or uplink is in our setup), then we will route via
that node in our setup. If the node or his uplink is not in our setup, then
the nodelist is used and normal fidonet routing is used. This means, if you
are a node, everything goes to your hub, if you are a hub, then mail for
your downlinks will go direct to the downlinks because they are in your setup, 
everything else goes to the host. 
If you are a host, then your own downlinks will get the mail direct,
the downlinks of the hubs in your net well be routed via the hubs below you.
If it is for a node in your region but outside your net, mail will be routed via
the other hosts in your region. Mail to outside your region will go to the
region coordinators system.

<h3>Tracking and bouncing</h3>
<p>
At this moment there is no bouncing of undeliverable mail. I will built this
in, but it will only work inside your own net. I will never include code for
bouncing mail outside your net, because nodelists are always not uptodate.
<p>&nbsp;<P>

<h3>Special routing</h3>
<p>
What if you need special routing. The solution is simple, add the routing
nodes to your setup and fill in the "route via" field. If you don't have a
session password with that node, leave the password fields blank. This node
will never know that he is in your setup as long as you have the notify
settings for that node switched off. To figure
out such solutions yourself, I have included the flow diagrams for the tracking
module.
