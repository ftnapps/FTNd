To handle incoming calls you can use <strong>mgetty</strong> written by
Gert Doering, (gert@greenie.muc.de). Others may work. You have to compile
<strong>mgetty</strong> with the -DFIDO flag to accept Fidonet mailer calls.
If you want incoming PPP calls as well, add the -DAUTO_PPP as well. If you want
to use ISDN, make sure you have ISDN support compiled in the kernel.
Below you can see the mgetty.config and login.config for mgetty that you may
need. 
I have also included a part of my /etc/inittab to show how <strong>mgetty
</strong> will spawn from <strong>init</strong>.

# login.config
#
# This is a sample "login dispatcher" configuration file for mgetty
#
# Format:
#	username userid utmp_entry login_program [arguments]
#
# Meaning:
#       for a "username" entered at mgettys login: prompt, call
#	"login_program" with [arguments], with the uid set to "userid",
#	and a USER_PROCESS utmp entry with ut_user = "utmp_entry"
#
#
# Use this one for fido calls (login name /FIDO/ is handled specially)
#
#  mgetty has to be compiled with "-DFIDO", otherwise a fido call won't
#  be detected.
#
/FIDO/	mbse	fido	/opt/mbse/bin/mbcico @
#
#
# Automatic PPP startup on receipt of LCP configure request (AutoPPP).
#  mgetty has to be compiled with "-DAUTO_PPP" for this to work.
#  Warning: Case is significant, AUTOPPP or autoppp won't work!
#  Consult the "pppd" man page to find pppd options that work for you.
#  See also PPP-HOWTO on how to set this up.
#
/AutoPPP/ -	a_ppp	/etc/ppp/paplogin
#
# This is the "standard" behaviour - *dont* set a userid or utmp
#  entry here, otherwise /bin/login will fail!
#  This entry isn't really necessary: if it's missing, the built-in
#  default will do exactly this.
#  Here we replace the standard login with MBSE BBS login:
#
*	-	-	/opt/mbse/bin/mblogin @
#
#
# end of login.config

I have added the <strong>-i /opt/mbse/etc/issue</strong> options to the 
<strong>mgetty</strong> line in /etc/inittab. 
The file /opt/mbse/etc/issue is a plain textfile to give a small banner just
before the login prompt. 
It could look like this:<br>
<pre>

        .--.     Welcome at MBSE BBS Development.
       |o_o |    --------------------------------
       |:_/ |
      //   \ \   This may or may not work today...
     (|     | )
    /'\_   _/`\
    \___)=(___/  
Powered by GNU/Linux.

</pre>
There is a default /opt/mbse/etc/issue installed by the installation script.
You need to edit this to insert your bbs name in it or even completely replace
this file for a nicer one. Don't make it too big, don't put control characters
or ANSI sequences in it as this may prevent some mailers to connect to your system.
<p>
I discovered that some systems don't have the right permissions on the serial
port for MBSE BBS. To fix this type the following commands:
<pre>
su
password: <em>enter root password here</em>
chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0
chown uucp.uucp /dev/ttyS0
exit
</pre>
Note that /dev/ttyS0 is for COM1, /dev/ttyS1 for COM2 etc. This is not a nice
solution. If youre system allows it, try to add the the user <b>mbse</b> as
a legal user of your serial ports. Most distributions have some tool for this.
