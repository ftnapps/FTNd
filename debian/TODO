Debian TODO for FTNd
--------------------

Packaging:
----------

- Add reference to the NNTP interface, since that will be a primary interface.

- Move any needed permissions fixes from debian/ftn.postinst to debian/rules.

- Add note to README.Debian regarding manually setting password for system user ftnd?

- Add example(s) for ftnd nginx config?

- Create man pages for executables;  for instance, using help2man or html2man?.
  Or create basic man pages that points to the html documentation? Or change 
  upstream files to a source type that can be used to create html & man pages
  as neccessary.

- With purge; remove user:group ftnd:ftnbbs?  Remove /opt/ftnd directory.
- With at least purge, if not also remove:  remove statoverrides (Won't be an issue
  after they're removed from ftnd.postinst.)

- Add creation of a ftnd-dbg package (ref http://wiki.debian.org/DebugPackage)

- Change the installation directory to /usr/lib/ftnd?

- Create & use debian/po, so that any debconf messages can be translated?


Configuration:
--------------

- Run ftnsetup as part of postinst for a new installation?  Or just advise that it should
  be run asap after a new install?  (Perhaps put a note about it in debian/News?)

- Add note about needing an FTN Nodelist

- Add a note about configuring html Docs root (1.15), URL Name, Author
    name. perhaps a note about the 'Hist. Limit'
    Example docs root => /opt/ftnd/var/www

- Create an example stats index file.

- will need to add a note about updating the config for that?

- Add a note, with details and/or pointing to example files, for configuring a web server.
(don't think it's already in the documentation?)
